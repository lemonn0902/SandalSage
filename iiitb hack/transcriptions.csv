SandalWoodNewsStories_282,"Now what has happened is, if someone is lying down, if he has a tractor, he will call someone and pull out the seeds here. There is no seed left. He will pull out the tractor. He will spray a chemical. He doesn't know what those chemicals are. Why is he scared? He is scared because of heat. It's not heat. The medicine that you sprayed on your forehead has come. That is what causes cancer. We will see how it goes for the next 9 days. If they want to come for farming, if they want to work, they will work hard. So can they come? No, they can come. After they come, they should not come saying, they should earn 2 lakhs per month, 3 lakhs, 4 lakhs. Definitely they will earn 20 lakhs per month. But they should love it. They should put money aside in monetary terms. Then they will come. It takes this much time. That's the way. But they can earn and earn. But not fast. Now, after finishing some work, you go to the campus interview immediately, and get an offer letter, job. Not like that. Do you have to work on weekends? No. No? No. Oh. What is your secret? 24 hours? No, no. You can be weak and rich. You can be lazy. I am like that. What do you think? I am the boss of my work. I will take my time. I want to talk to you. I want to cook with you. I want to work with you. I want to talk to you. I have no problem. No problem. So you don't want to work on weekends? No. Four kids have finished their exams. I am the one who is not working. I don't want to tell anyone. I will be working all day for a month. This is a very, very holistic job. This is a very peaceful way of life. There is no unity here. There is no target. There is no fire. There is nothing. Nothing. But there is no agriculture. There is no loss. There is no loss. I have discussed this much. I need a plan. I need a long term plan. I need a short term plan. What I am saying is... What happens is... I take a pen and draw a line. I draw a line and draw a meter every day. I draw a meter every day. Step by step. I need a little time to start. But I am at peace now. I have a system. You have seen it yourself. I have not done anything at this time. You have not done anything at this time? I have already done more than 50%. Then I am getting natural regeneration. I am getting natural regeneration. Once I start, I will start to work. You will not get any work. But I need time. I will start working. I have started working. I will start to speak this year. This is about 20 years of work. I have 20 years of experience. This is about 20 years of experience. This is the first time. This is the first time. I can say anything. I can say anything. I can say anything. I can say anything. You need 20 years to work. When I started, I did not know what was happening immediately. I did not know what magic I did. How to protect the Earth and how to protect Earth. How can I make a full-fledged effort to these steps? It took me approximately two decades to achieve this. What have I done now? It is complete. There is still work to be done. I know what to do. I know how much to do. I know how much to improve. Is there more work to be done? There is 90% more work to be done. There is so much work to be done. This is an ocean. We have to do the work of agriculture. Agriculture is a very interesting field. It is very interesting. I will say something. In this world, any job, any profession, any political life, any health, any education, any spiritual life, is given only by agriculture. Agriculture alone. There is health, education and both. There is a life of education, a life of health and a life of education. I am going to BOSHA here. I have a lot of unplanned trips. I will spend more time with my family. It is an opportunity. Family time. There is no plan. We went last time. We went to some ocean beaches. We went to the forest gardens. Tomorrow there was a pending kneading. They weren't coming. We went to the re 1959. TheÙf Malyanadia and the ihm, that there is an economic and identity there. Master Kuntukkandam, he stayed when my parents died. for me, this is a big temple Butugu Aimsidhu Bujhar Miyan Alright, I cannot see anything special Like He told me, I am an specifyower at the small temple But, does Dizhan feel Treatd步 I am in a peaceful state, right? But I am not feeling anything here. This is the nature, right? It gives me a wonderful happiness. I have to experience it until I fall. I have to experience it. I can't express it. The nature is the nature of agriculture. There is no other nature. I am happy. Especially for me, we have built a lot of dams in Bisilnagar. A dam is now a possibility. The dams are not being built. There is no electricity here. You can see the sound. This is the atmosphere that has been built. But is it possible to build it in small quantities? Yes, it is possible. Rameshwar is a rich man. He has built a small dam. He has built a small dam. Rameshwar has been a rich man. He has built a dam. But he has become a small farmer. He has been working day and night. No, he can do better. Small families are called small families. That family is a big family. 100 acres of land. But even if there were 2-3 acres of land, he can do it. He can build a forest in 10 acres. It is possible. In half an acre, in one acre, he can build a forest. A farming forest. He can build a family forest. It is possible. He can build a different type of dam. He can also build a dam that is made of iron. It is possible. It is not possible for the poor. You can see that I have not built a big dam. I have not spent crores of money on building a poly house. I have not done anything like Israel. Nothing. It is a small thing. You should know do's and don'ts. If you do this, what? If you do this, what? If you do this, what? If you do this, what? What will you lose? What can you gain if you do this? It is a small thing. What our farmers are doing is, they are doing what they can and are doing it with their hands. They are doing it with their hands. Or traditional methods? Traditional method is ultimate. But we have already crossed many limits in our traditional life. You have crossed many limits in your traditional method. Today, our life is like, we should not have any bad smell. We should not have any bad smell. We should not have any bad smell. The reason why we are singing like this is, when we get the coconut, we strike. Our ancestors, ancestors, like the Sampradaya, they used to pick the best seeds and come in the year before. This year, they were fighting. They used to pick the seeds in the morning? Yes. They used to pick the seeds in the morning. All the seeds, like the dweela, akadi kaal, our Jola, sajje, all our oil seeds, all of them were picked, all were picked. Now, what has happened is, next year, if there are four seeds, they will pick them today. When they are picked, they will take the tractor, call someone and pick the seeds. They will not pick the seeds. They will take the tractor. They don't have a plan. If they don't have a plan, they don't take it seriously. They are sad. They don't have enthusiasm. That's the situation. Already, in the earth, we are collecting money today. As a result of the industrialization, the soil is getting worse. When the soil is getting worse, the moisture holding capacity is getting worse. The earth is losing the power to stop the evasions. Now, the time is when we eat biscuits and bread, processed foods. Chips, lez, this is our Srimanthikeya Pratika. We have become modernized. This is how life works. This is how it is. The agriculture after the 60s, is called the agriculture without noise. It is not the agriculture of the kingdom. It is called the agriculture without noise. Today, the farmer, if I may say, I will take a picture. The farming of today is that the farmer sprays a chemical. The chemical sprays the soil. The soil is the soil. The chemical sprays the soil. The farmer does not know what the chemicals are. He does not know what the government, the farmers, or our system is. He does not know what insecticide is used. He does not know what contact insecticide, systemic insecticide, or what fungicide is used. He does not know what contact fungicide, systemic fungicide, or broad spectrum fungicide is. We are going to a very important place. What will happen? If one plant is planted, in 100 acres, one of the 90 acres will be wasted. But this is already there. It has gone to that extent. Then it should be built. Otherwise, from the front, farmers will become more anxious. Because now it is already very close. Farming conditions,��게요 So, we should not underestimate the Rasayinikas, but should think seriously about the Sadhaka and Badhaka of Rasayinikas. That's why he was born. So, we should not underestimate them. But, the Rasayinikas, be it NPK Fertilizers, micro nutrients, be it stimulants, insecticides, pesticides, be it stimulants, all these are long-term and short-term. These are Sadhaka and Badhaka. We should make a system that is able to fully explain the work of a common citizen, the government, the job-seekers. That is not enough to work in the soul. What is happening today? I don't know if it is MRL. What is MRL? What is happening today? A Proclame sprays, or a Carbon Degenerator sprays, Methomil sprays, and today it sprays, and in the evening it is harvested and brought to the market. Methomil sprays, it is 90 days MRL. Is that the content? Yes, we are saying the maximum residue limit. It is not possible to eat it for 90 days. But, the next day it is being brought to the market. We, our children, our family are eating it. We are saying that it is fresh, shining, and that it is good. After eating it for 2-3 days, we start to talk about our stomach. Why is the stomach upset? It is not like that. It is because of the medicine it is given. The cancer is spreading in the stomach. The cancer is spreading in the stomach. This is happening. He doesn't know, he doesn't know that he has to do 90 days of Methomil harvesting. He doesn't know. He says, after spraying, the chemicals should be removed. He wants the medicine. He says, after he dies immediately, he will come to my house next day. He says, immediately. He will see the MRL, and ask, are you spraying now? How many days are you harvesting? Who knows? Who has the answer? Where is the person who knows the answer? He gave money, gave Methomil, died, died inside, no one is inside, he did all these. He gave the medicine to Santhi. We are all here. We are all farmers. We all we took it. We gave it to Santhi, if it is good or not, we took it home. We took the medicine for our young children. We took it for all the elderly people. It is the power of God. It is the power of God. It is the power of God. What are the educational programs? What are the awareness programs? There is no need. We need that. We need it. There is a seed, Sir. This is the seed.

SandalWoodNewsStories_287,"Namaskar! Welcome to Atmeyar Raitar with Sanchi TV News. Today we have come to Kottalagi village. We have come to the village of Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Till today, the situation has been like this. There were two Srikandada Gidakala on the hill. We don't know when they will take them away from the stone. But in the Taluka of Belagav district, in Kottalagi village, one farmer left all the traditional fields and started a Srikandada farm. That too in Hattuekara. Come and get to know that farmer. And also come and get to know all the Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Come and get to know the farmer first. My name is Sidra Irapa, from L.D. I am from Belagavanjala, in the Taluka of Atmeyar Raitar, Kottalagi. I used to do farming. My ancestors used to do farming. Later I started farming. How did you get the idea to start a Srikandada Gidakala farm? Now, if we want to start a Srikandada farm, it will be done on its own. Because, when we do it on our own, we are doing it by ourselves. The labor rate has increased. The rate of cow dung has increased. The rate of medicine has increased. Now, in terms of investment, in the absence of work, the situation has become like this. Now, Menaka Nagamma's family, if they have their own family, they can work and earn their living. Now, we have to work like this. If we have to water the fields, we have to work from the side. We have to work from the side. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. How many acres of Srikandada Gidakala have you planted? How many trees have you planted in one acre? How many trees have you planted in the middle? I planted Srikandada Gidakala in 10 acres of land. In total, I planted 80 acres of land. In 80 acres, I have planted 10-15% of the land. Now, in one acre, I have planted 325 trees. How much is the difference? There are 16 trees on one side and 8 trees on the other side. Now, I have planted 300 trees. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. I have been planting for the past year. This is the first year. It's been 3 years. If we plant more trees, it will take another 2 years. We have been planting for more than a year. If we look at the trees we have planted, it's not easy to plant more trees. In our village, there is a tree called Kaka Kuru. It's growing on the ground. In that tree, we have planted 425 trees. We have been thinking about it. We have been thinking about it. If we save a tree, we can save 1 lakh trees. We have been thinking about it since the time of the Kuru family. We have come to this work. How many types of trees are there in Srikandada Gidakala? Which type of trees have you planted? How do you manage the trees? There are different types of trees in Srikandada Gidakala. One is the only tree. In any other country, we have the same tree. We have the same tree. In Srirangapatnam, they plant these trees. At the same time, they plant other trees. In Kandha, we have a lot of trees. We plant all of them. We plant 2-3 trees. But when they go abroad, they go to Canada and they grow. They make a difference there. They grow different plants. They grow more than 20% of the plants. They grow on their soil and on their climate. What are the medicines used for the plants of Srikanth? Now, the soil of Srikanth is soft. The soil is soft and the plants are soft. Then the plants are not ready. The plants are not ready. In Malinak, there is a place called Nelkut. It is 21% of the plants. Here, the plants are growing well. The more the plants grow, the better the plants are. The plants are ready in the fields. There are 8 small plants in the field. That is one of the reasons. How long does the water stay there? For the plants, the water needs to be kept for compulsory 7 years. The water is kept for 7 days. How long does the water stay there? The water is kept for 7 days. For 7 days, the water is kept for 1 hour. It is kept in the basi-git. It is kept in the basi-git for 3-4 months. How do you make the medicine? There is no need for any other medicine. We just make it in small pieces. We make it in small pieces. We make paste for that. We make paste of rice and wheat. We make paste and then we make it into a paste. We make paste once a year. There is no need for any other medicine. There is no need for anything else. What is the need for the Srikandakida plant? What is the profit? We have done a little research on the Srikandakida plant. But we have not done any research on that. We have asked the market. We have asked the government to do some research. They say that the plant can grow up to 20,000-24,000 kg. My Town has founded a association called the Srikandakida plant. To help the country grow, we have authorized private-cloth quiz to the Officers. Actually we have about to turn 13In the suffeniating period. We trust the government to help us by paying down a 20-$ a month commission after which plan bids are to be held. We keep ourselves in supply and will be safe until that at the end of seed season. How long can you work? We have to work for 16 years. We can get 1 lakh rupees for one year. We can get 1 lakh easily. Before, you didn't work for 16 years. For one year, you get 10% more salary. You didn't work for 8 years. If you work for 20 years, you get 1 lakh rupees for 5 years. For 16 years, you get 1 lakh rupees. For 5 years, you can get 1 lakh rupees. This is Srikanda. We have to work. If we need it, we can get it. If we don't get the rate, we can get 1 lakh rupees. Who allowed you to build Srikanda? We don't need any permission. We don't need any permission. The reason is, our farmers don't have any knowledge about this. Government government gave us permission to build Srikanda. Farmers ask permission to build Srikanda. But, we don't have any knowledge about this. We have been working here for 8 years. Our farmers don't have any knowledge about this. So, we are asking you to give us the rate of 10 crores. Why? Because we gave you 20,000 rupees. But, you didn't give us the rate. We are asking you to give us the rate. This is Chitradur. This is Haived. We built this. This is the place where we sold this to the farmers. They built this here. They built this here. They didn't give the information to others. Now, we are asking you to give us the rate. We are asking you to give us the rate. Did you pick any other Srikanda plant? This is the Srikanda savalambi plant. This is the paravalambi plant. This is the chogisitri plant. This plant is growing in the chogisitri plant. Where did it grow? 5 years ago. 5 years ago, it was growing on the ground. Now, it needs a support dander. This is the chogisitri plant. It is growing here. It needs another 3-4 years. If we plant another plant here, it will grow well. It will grow well. When will it grow? It will grow well. It will grow well. It will not grow well. It will not grow well. It will not grow well. It will grow well. I had a plant called maathikeya. It didn't get a name. It didn't get a name. It got a name. How long has it been since the last 16 years? It has been growing well. It has been growing well for 3 years. After 3 years, it has not grown well. It is difficult to grow well. It is difficult to grow well. It can be planted in the garden. It can be planted in the garden. It is like this. There were other plants here. It was pure. It was all mixed. This is gold. We have done a lot of research. We have done a lot of research. This is the best. It is not good for us. There were 5-6 plants here. We have done a lot of research. Our garden is pure. It has been 3 years. In that, 3 plants have grown well. I am able to plant this plant. This is golden. It is pure. It is not a big problem. But if you have a problem, you can help. Yes, it is not a big problem. But now the Srikandha is not growing like this. It is a little less. But if we want to grow more, we can start the cultivation. We can plant 2 lakhs of seeds. We can plant 2 lakhs of seeds. Srikandha has two or three trees. One or two trees are there in the forest. They are afraid of color. And you have planted Srikandha trees in the forest. How did you protect yourself from the color? How did you protect yourself from the color? If there were only one or two trees, I would have planted them in the forest. No one would have come to this forest. No one would have asked for this. The people who are here and who have helped us, they have confidence. It has been three years now. Three years ago, we had planted trees in our forest. When we planted Srikandha trees, no one came to this forest. They came here. They were afraid of color. They were afraid of color. They wanted to show us a bigger forest. But we didn't cut the trees. We didn't cut trees. They planted trees in Uddeshpur. We got the seeds, but we couldn't get them. We made a big team, and we asked the people below, we made a big team, and we had made rafalee type and we had 100-200 people and truckers and we were below them.

Chandasekar was my classmate. His son, Abha Vishwa, is the person who acted in that case. We all trust him. Sundar is the only son. He's a software engineer. He's a young boy. Udda, he's a boy named Udda. He's a 6 feet tall boy. He's a 6 feet tall Udda. He's a very amazing artist. He's played in the Kempammana court case. He directed a short film. It was a great short film. It was a great short film. What was the name of the film? It was called Reckoning. Reckoning. I didn't understand English. I was in 8th grade. It was a great film. Now, Sanjay Shantaram, the father of our Swami Ayyappa film, Ayyappa Swami, was in the film. He was the leading actor in the film, in the film, Manne Kempe Gowda. He had a wonderful performance. I went to his memorial and I advised him for the first time. It's very easy for those who know dance and recording. But if you enter a battlefield and meet the battlefield, it will be very nice. You will be able to accept the acting more. I advised him to learn different techniques. Now, my other disciple, my younger one, Vivekanth Bagalkoti, he's a software engineer. He's directing a film called Kushmanda Roopa. In that film, he's one of the heroes. He can be a second hero or anti-hero. What do you think about Kushmanda Roopa? You've worked for two days, right? When I saw Kushmanda Roopa, I told him a lot of stories. I didn't tell him the whole story. Because he didn't like to leave the story. How old are you with your father? Chandanavanna Fort. You were going to find water from the bottom. I saw it in my dream. To save the animals from gunfire, you and your father made cement blocks in the ground. We built a fort for each other. Veera shot all that. It's amazing. How did you come up with the idea of forming a forest? Are you more interested in the forest? After the kids play, the kids will be like this. How do you feel about building a water source on the top of the fort? The history of the fort is about 10-12 years. You said 14 years. We built a fort. We built a fort and watered it for 12 years. There were no facilities for water. My father used to cut the trees and water the forest. We used to cut the trees for 6 acres. Now everything is checked down. We have two motors. Water comes to rest. There is no problem with that. Water comes and it gets light. Now there are many problems with the rocks. What we know is that we put the water in the corners. In the corners, someone put a layer of water in the center. We knew how much water we could get. They were checking it. Since then, my father and I thought about it. We thought about putting sensors in it. But there was no sensor supply. We thought about what we could do with it. So, my father and I came up with an idea. We made 8K blocks. We thought that we can afford the cost. We thought it would be cheaper than the cost. We produced 50-60 feet of stone. We produced and produced and produced. We have put 150 blocks in the fort. We have put the local lights in the fort. We have cemented it and made the concrete. We have built a fort slowly. We have built it strong. You have built a fort. Only rainwater goes in. You are not using the ground. We have to give space for the water to rise. We have put one foot apart. There should be space for the water to rise. There should be space for the rain to rise. Apart from farming, apart from farming, do you want to move forward in cinema or software business? Or do you want to continue in the field of farming? What is your goal? What do you think? If I say software, we don't outsource. We have made a product called TV Connect. You have set up a studio. How much have you done? I have set up a studio in a big studio. I have acted and dubbed. I have set up a studio in a big studio. When you were young, you wanted to know about it. What should I do at this age? I am at that age. When you were young, I came to the film industry. You have all been born with a golden spoon. You may be my son or you may be me. You have come to sleep well. You have come to sleep well. You didn't come last time, right? How do you feel? Software engineers or people who go to work, they are jobless. They should come on Saturdays and Sundays. It is difficult to get there. It is about 20 km. 25 km from the center. 25 km from the center. They should come on Saturdays and Sundays. They should chill on Mondays. They have made a good place and a good atmosphere. What do you think of games? I have a lot of games. I was very happy to see this. I was very happy. I was very happy. All the best for your future. My son Vishveshwara, is a good boy. He is already a good boy. I am very proud of him. He is a very good boy. He is a very talented boy. He has a good base voice. He has a good heart for everything.

SandalWoodNewsStories_89,"We have given the money to the government. Otherwise, we would not have been able to survive. So, we have been waiting for 15 years for the money to be given to Srikanth. So, we have to make sure that we have the money to support Srikanth. We have to pay the same amount of money. We have done this for the first time. Srikanth is weak because of the bad conditions of the land. He has been suffering for the last two years. He is weak because of the bad conditions of the land. You have to understand that when your land is weak, it is a clue of nature. Your heart would have been done. You are at the right direction of the land load cultivation. You should have that experience. I haveösprEs que ifno We have We do not have a good rating. We have done a lot of bad things. We have been doing a lot of bad things for the last three or four years. When it is enough for the next two years, we will sell the crop. Why? Because we need to get the crop for the next two years. If we do not get the crop for the next two years, it will not be good for us. We have been doing the crop for the first two years. We have been doing all the intercultivation for the last seven years. We have done all the work of the crop. We have been doing zero cultivated land for the last eight years. We have done nothing. Because the route of Srikand has become very big. People are trying to get the stem of the plant. The route of the plant is three times bigger than the stem. Oil content is very high. The oil content of Srikand in Karnataka is 6% oil. Whereas in other states, it is not 1% to 2%. The reason why I am doing this for Karnataka is because the land has already given you the gift of God. Nature has stopped you from doing this. You are not understanding it. What is the reason for this? After eight years, how will you get the crop? How should we do this? Because the route of Srikand is not inside. If one jerk falls on your tractor, it thinks that I am in the city. You have to create a current for that. How much ever you try, it will fall. So, you have to do this in a natural way or artificial way? Srikand has given water to the plant. You have to give water to the plant. Because it has water in it. When you give water, it will carry the water. It doesn't have water in it. So, from the initial stage, Srikand has given water to the plant. After seven to eight years, the water should be completely stopped. The water should be completely stopped. The more water you stop, the bigger the crop will be. Srikand should have a big crop. That is why it is called a big crop. Another thing is that the crop is bigger than everything. If you don't have a big crop, the crop will be very hard. Especially during rainy season. If the crop is hard during rainy season, the excess water will be very hard. Srikand has to take the hard work. If you clean the crop, the excess water will be very hard. The crop will be very big. If you let the water to be full, you will not get any crop. You have to do this in a natural way. How much water do you have? We have only one inch of water. We have no water. We have to feed eight thousand people with one inch of water. How? We have to feed ten thousand people. Then we will have to stop the mulching. If you don't plant it completely, we will suffer from crosses with over-ouged pl蒸ch We not only have to do the work but also need not感覺. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. We have done a lot of work in the Jeevampurtha Panchakavai. After 5 years. We don't need anything. We don't need anything. We get what we want. We don't need to support anything. So, we need to know when to do anything. I didn't do anything in the initial stage. They would eat my chicken. I did it after 5 years. They eat my chickens. They eat my chickens. I will show you. They eat my chickens. They eat my chickens. So, it helps you. I will feed them once. I will feed them once. I will feed them once. I will feed them once. You will get good results. One more thing. The fear of losing Balashtra Mandi Shriigandha. Yes. There is no revolution in the first place. There is no change in the present. I will tell you. You have to decide the future. I have been saying that Shriigandha is 16000 rupees per kg. Our farmers get 100 rupees per kg. They get 40 rupees per kg. So, we have a marginal rate. You get 5000 rupees per kg. You get 4000 rupees per kg. We don't have that. Because the farmers get only half of it. If you get 5000 rupees per kg, you get 20 kg of wheat per kg. 20 x 5000 is 1 lakh rupees per kg. 300 kg of wheat per kg. They have built 3 crores of wheat. They have built it. That is the current rate. Yesterday, a man from KSD called me. He said that he will go to the General Manager. He said that the rate is 11500 rupees per kg. I will not tell you that. If I don't tell you that, you will not believe me. I am happy to tell you that I will not get it. I am very happy. I will give you a marginal rate. If you get it, you will get 35 kg. I will give you 20 kg. Otherwise, I will go to my house. We will go to our house. Whatever you do, you get 10 kg per day. If you get 50 kg per day, you get 50,000 rupees per day. If you get 300 crores per day, you get 300 crores per day. From where do you get that? 12 to 15 years. That is how much we get. Why? Because the Tannan Thali Master worked for 40 years and got a retirement. We all have done the same. If you go to your house, you will get a lot of money. If you work for 10 to 15 years, you will get crores. My parents, my grandparents, they will not get a crore. I will tell you why this is a bad time. We have done all the work and never got a crore. We have done the work of stealing, cheating, cheating, stealing, stealing, and we have never got a crore. That is why I am telling you to do this work. If you have gold in your house, you will get a lot of money. If you don't have gold, you will not be able to work. When you are gone, you will not be able to serve the land. You will not be able to pay the rent. When you are gone, you will not be able to pay the legal market to build a government building. You will not be able to make brown sugar or sugarcane. Why are you asking me this question? You have a contribution from your side. All these things are not possible. These are the nature's anger. Why are they not possible? We are not able to do anything against nature. Now it is time for you to contribute to nature. Why are you not doing anything wrong? When you have done this, why did you do something wrong? Why is Veerappan famous today? He said that if he had done the Shingapuram work, he would have become famous. He did the Srigandha work. But in reality, he did not succeed in the work. There is no hope. Why are the eyes so strong? Because you are weak. You have forgotten the strength of your body. This is not the way to be free from the world. If Bhagat Singh was dead, when would we be able to be free? We are not free. We are not able to do anything to be free. We have to be strong and brave. because today each of my trees are at the age of 7 years, they have brought the worth of 65 cm sir, which is possible at the age of 15 years. So what I am saying is, the soil here is even better sir, because your Malnad is made of Shrigandha, Taurmani and Gandhinmani. You are coming to the top, so you have to come one step ahead. And regarding protection aspect, I am telling about the E-protection system. What is E-protection system? We are putting a microchip in the middle, this is operated through sensors, there is no wire like this. Where do the signals come from? Through satellites. Then what we do for this is, we have to connect the ground and outer world. For that we give four gateway connections through routers. Modern it interacts with only one device, whereas router interacts with multi devices. One of this connection will be given to IWST server. What is IWST? Indian Wood Science Technology. They are doing all the trees' research. They will give you a drone in this system, in that you have day vision camera and dark vision cameras. Day vision means, if someone comes inside, they will tell you that it is night time, and there is light in all the places, and it is not even a month. For that, dark vision camera works, wherever an image comes from, it will automatically turn on. They will capture the black and white image and send it to IWST. If it is a human, it is a life-threatening thing. Then they will give you a name plate, one, two, three, four. If you give these 100, it will send an alert message immediately. One for your mobile, one for the nearest police station. You are not in the village, the construction is done, but because of that chip, it will show the location exactly where your wood is moving in which direction. So now you are risk free. But now, we have to pay 2000 rupees for this. For one year, they will pay 2000 rupees for the construction, and then they will return it once. They will keep the money for the goods. They have given all the goods. Then we have to pay 100 rupees per month for the construction. 24 into 7, they are working for us. So this is e-protection. Here, it is 100 rupees per tree. So now I am asking the government to give me the cost of the construction. So what I will say is, you have to pay more than one hej. If the water is more, how will you pay the hej? How much water will you pay? Actually, we don't need water. Sir, we have reduced the water. Since the initial stage, the price of the water has increased. We have reduced the water. We don't need water. Why do we need water? Why do we need water? Because we have to pay more than one hej. But if we add more water, we can't get water. We have to pay 100 rupees per hectare. We are not that capable. But at the end of 12 to 15 years, you have to see your children's court. Because if they say, I will try, they will not be able to control. She should also feel proud that I am a wife of a farmer. That day should come. My struggle is for only that. Madam, you said that you have maintained labor on one labor. Exactly. This is 8 acres, 10 acres, 8,000 acres. One labor. But you said that you don't have to pay any money. So, you don't need labor. I am saying that, you don't need labor. You can't get any profit from the labor. We have to give you coconut, coconut, coconut, coconut. You don't need to give anything else. That's it. Then you don't need water. We have to drip the water. We have to drip the water. We have to drip 4 liters per hour. We have to drip 10 liters per hour. We have to make holes and then we have to drill. So, you have to do it in one day. We have to do it in a sub-wall. Water has become less. One wall, two walls, three walls, four walls. If there is a little water, the front wall will be closed. If there is a little water, the pressure will be lost. Because I know my weakness. I am doing my weakness as my power point. Then I am doing my weakness. Because we are doing this, we have to eat this, we have to take antioxidants. We can't get money anywhere. So, you are eating the soil of the soil. When the water is flowing, when the soil is below the water, you are giving so much power to the soil. This is natural farming. And many living beings are surprised by that weakness. If you clean it, the electricity won't come. Microorganisms, chemicals. So, this is the system I have done in my side. Because we know that if the water is less, we can't do farming. We have left our village to get labour. For the last two years, the capacity of the farmers is very low. Because they have become very poor. So, we have decided to do all these things. That is why we are doing this. Where did you come from? From Kerala. This is your entry-star property. No, I am not an entry-star property. There was a small road on the side. We had to get a motorcycle. There was a lot of road. When did I start all this? There was no water, no electricity. There was nothing. We have exported all this. We needed a place to go. We needed a road. Now, we have done all this. There was a big hole in the wall. We took the wall and made a road. We have made a road and leveled everything. We have taken the stones. We have done all this with great difficulty. There is nothing. We have a mountain on the ground. There is a CPC. We have made a well on the top. We have not been able to get any food from the hospital. We have drenched the ground. We have water in the well. We have bamboo in the well. The water is flowing. The water is flowing. It is flowing. Hello. Why don't you call me when there is no water? There is no need for more water. We have to manage it. We have to manage it. If there is more water... What? We have to absorb more water and use it for Srikanth. We have to talk. Ravi! You said this is a life-saving thing. Is it a life-saving thing? That is what I am saying. Our capacity is not enough. We don't have any labour. They will work for us and send us to Bangalore. They will give us 2-3 lakh rupees. We have to do everything. My capacity is not enough. I will come and work on my own. I will do all the work. They will come and do the work. They will leave us. We don't have any work. I will do all the work. I will talk to my 30-35 people. I will talk to them. I will talk to them. We have to work. They will do all the work. They will not go anywhere. They will do everything. We will not let them do anything. You will not pass the electricity to the electricity? No, we will not. We will not do it. We will not do it. We will not do this fencing. We will not do this fencing. If you do solar fencing, you will not get any electricity. It will be hurting. If we put this in the wind, it will not blow. It will not dry. It will not dry. We will put it as a wind breaker. We will put a seed apple plant next to it. It is an anti-virus. We will have to work like a medicine plant. Is this plant management? Yes, we have it. Is it safe to plant it? Yes, it is safe. It is safe. Water is bad. It is not good. It is very bad. It is very bad. We will plant it in the wind. It will not work. It will not work. It is very bad. It is very bad. It is very bad. We will plant 100 plants in the wind. We will plant 100 plants in the wind. No one has done this. No one has done this. We have to pay from 15 to 20 rupees. 50 rupees? I will tell you why. We cannot recognize if anyone has done this. Everyone does this. Everyone does this. We have to pay 2 lakh rupees per acre. We have to pay 10,000 rupees per acre. Even if you have 30 rupees per kilo, you can get 6 tons of crop per acre. You can get 6 tons of crop per acre. 2 lakhs is coming in any way. I don't know. I don't need to spend 2 lakhs and get 3 lakhs. I don't have to do anything. I have 2 lakhs. That is natural farming. Water is bad. Water is bad. I will show you. I will show you. Is this method called Aranya Christian method? This is natural farming, organic farming, zero budget farming. Zero budget means nothing is invested. That is what we do. 6 by 6. First, I will show you. Then I will show you. After that, all doubts are cleared.",we have given the money to the government otherwise we would not have been able to survive so we have been waiting for years for the money to be given to srikanth so we have to make sure that we have the money to support srikanth we have to pay the same amount of money we have done this for the first time srikanth is weak because of the bad conditions of the

SandalWoodNewsStories_43,"Hi India, so today I am in Bangalore. Actually the rarest of rare person we are interviewing with personality regarding Sandalwood. Actually in recent days Sandalwood is booming a lot, you all know that right? So that's why the rarest of rare person, now I have come to Bangalore to interview. So we have Ananth Padmanabhan here. Hello sir. Hello. So we have come to interview with him. Actually he is the father of Sandalwood. So with them we will learn Sandalwood cultivation, nursery and some tips. So come. Sir, Sandalwood is a very rare thing. What is your opinion sir? Sandalwood is now becoming a very rare thing. In Karnataka we call it as Gandhandagudi. Now it is called as Durghandagudi. So it is a very rare thing. In the past we used to get around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of sandalwood. Now we are not getting more than 10 tonnes of sandalwood. Now even the oil is not being used. In Karnataka we use around 80 to 90 tonnes of sandalwood. So they use whatever they get. No one gives it to them. The reason why this is happening is because we have been getting a lot of sandalwood from our country. The forest department has not lost much. In Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other places, we have not lost much sandalwood. There is a lot of demand for sandalwood. If we want to meet that demand, we have to participate privately. We have to grow sandalwood even if it is private. If we grow it as much as possible, it will be very helpful for the sandalwood industry. Sir, if it is a private industry, do you need to get permission? Or can everyone grow it? No one is allowed to grow sandalwood. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, they have amended the forest policy. In 2001-2002, they have amended the forest policy. They can grow sandalwood for anyone. After that, they have to grow sandalwood. They have declared that the sandalwood is their own property. They have made a policy to build it and to work on it. They have made a policy to build it for the forest department. That is a very bad thing. We have told our private landowners that they have no right to do so. They have given us the certificate of forest department for the sandalwood industry. If we study this in agriculture, it can be changed for anyone. The landowners have not been given the certificate of forest department. They have to work on it. The government has taken this as a condition. They have given us the government's rules to change it for anyone. The farmers are growing sandalwood. They grow it and save it. If they save it and give it to us, they will also get the certificate. We have not been able to get the certificate. We have decided to change the policy of forest department. Basically, the Karnataka government is supporting this policy. Do each state have its own rules? Do all states have the same rules? No, even if we have the same rules, the forest department is a state subject. We have rules for each state. Karnataka and Tamilnadu are on the same page. There is no state that can say anything against the rules. They have to change it. Only Karnataka and Tamilnadu have the same rules. People are asking about the permit for the first seed. Many people are saying that they don't want to plant sandalwood. Many people are doubting which seed is correct and which is wrong. What is your opinion? According to the old forest system, it is wrong to plant a tree with a good quality. Because when a tree is in bloom, it should be replanted and grown. We have not been able to plant it for 22 years. We have collected the seed for 4 years and 5 years. We are using it for cultivation. The Oxford Dictionary has put a TLA. It says that when a tree starts to bloom, it is reproductively matured. We are using the seed to grow the tree. We can prepare it for the cultivation. We have not been able to do it. We have to take 25 years to get the tree. It is difficult to get it after 25 years. We can plant it in the nursery. We can get the seed for the 3rd year. We can also get the seed for the 2nd year. We can get it for the 2nd year. I have taken the seed from IWST. I have compared it with the seed from the outside. IWST seed is actually wrong. The seed from the outside is a bit small. Is there any difference? We have studied the seed. We have made the seed into three types. One is small, medium and the other is big. We have made it into three types. Even if we take the medium seed, it will yield good results. We have taken the seed from the outside. We have taken the seed from the outside. We have made it into three types. It will yield good results. It is difficult to get the seed from the outside. One assumption is that if the seed is big, it will yield good results. That is wrong. The seed will have more than the plantain acid content. It will have less content. The germination is also not related to that. Can we get the seed for any year? We get the seed for the 2nd year. We get it in April and in September and October. We can get the seed for any season. You are doing nursery work. How much is the sapling per kg? We get 5 to 5.5 thousand seeds per kg. We have developed that. We have 50% of the seed. We have 50% of the seed. We put the seed in the seed bed. We put all the seeds in the seed bed. We treat the seed with the seed bed. We get 50% of the germination. We get 20% of the germination. We have developed it well. We get the seed for the growth. We get the seed for the growth. We get the seed for the growth. And we get the seed for the growth. When we go to the nursery, we should spray the insecticide and fungi from the first week. We should be doing it for a week. If we are doing it, the seeds that we are picking, we should not give any trouble to the good seeds. Now, what is common is that when we are picking from the seeds, we get a fungus called Fusarium, and then we get another fungus called Pythium. Similarly, we get a fungus called Nemetode. When the two fungus are mixed together, it will definitely harm the seed. When we get the fungus, we mix the two fungus of the insecticide and spray it. Even if we get such diseases, we can easily control them.

Shrikandha was born in Karnataka in the year of Heralavai. Today it is Virala. Shrikandha has a religious status that is not appropriate for it. In our Pooja rituals, Shrikandha has a very high status. Why? Because the Lord has given the quality of living in the forest. So, Shrikandha has a religious status. What is the purpose of Shrikandha? Before using Shrikandha as a medicine, we should first see the qualities of Shrikandha. This is not Shrikandha, viewers. This is the Shita-Virya-Dravya. It is the Dravya that gives the body the strength and strength. Then, how should we use Shrikandha? We should give the smell of Shrikandha to the children. Itøs a good idea to use Shrikandha in cure of any ailments, which are related to hair, hair follicles, fall arise, But with that, every day, a stone, a stone found in the temple, the smell of the stone is washed with water, and the smell is spread on the face, and after one hour, after washing it in cold water, the wrinkles on the face are getting worse. The skin is getting worse. Dark circles are getting worse. Any kind of skin diseases matters. Shrikandha's oil can be used to make oil. When we use Shrikandha's oil in the skin diseases, the skin diseases and the wounds from the skin are being treated. This way, when we use Shrikandha in our daily life, in the use of internal and external resources, we are able to get rid of the limited wounds. Therefore, we are able to protect and grow Shrikandha's trees. I would like to share this with everyone. I would like to discuss this with everyone. Let's discuss this in the next session.

SandalWoodNewsStories_278,"Now, every day, we are bringing to you the stories of the four parts of the state, the farmer Yashogathe and their experiences. But today, we are introducing you to various farmers. Yes, from a young age, they grow and grow and grow new crops. They are inspired by these farmers. Gandhada Bedu, Sri Gandhada Nadu, is a famous state in Karnataka. We must be proud of this. First, the farmers of Sri Gandhada did not grow their crops on their own land. But, there is no problem. The government is also encouraging this growing. So, the farmer's farming has started in different parts of the state since the last few years. Many farmers have grown their crops since the last few days. In a small village, Gopalakrishna, Kolarajilliya, Bailusime, has grown his crop in 12 acres of Sri Gandhada. Here, you are seeing the half-settled village of Kolarathaluku, the garden of Gopalakrishna. The fields of Sri Gandhada here are about 6 years old. There are no more than 2000 trees here. The farmers are trying to get water for their crops. Sri Gandhada Paravalambi Gita. The farmers say that this is grown in the soil as a mixture. In the half-settled village, in survey number 59, I have grown 12 acres of Sri Gandhada. When I grow Sri Gandhada, I have to plant Paravalambi with it. The water and coconut water is not enough to grow this tree. So, I have grown it with this mango tree. It needs water for 2 years. I have grown it with a drip. The reason for the pruning is that the tree has developed. We don't prune much from the lower part. We only take 3 feet from the lower part. We plant the trees like this. It has been 6 years since we started this farm. The soil is not very bright. It is bright as it is. The soil is not very good. The department says that the soil will start to rot after 10 to 12 years. As per me, it will take 20 years. It has been 6 years since I started this farm. Today, all the farmers are preparing to plant mango trees in the fields. Now, 500 people have planted mango trees. We are growing mangoes in the afternoon. We have planted tomatoes, avaregad, beans, papaya, and all other fruits. We have grown mangoes in this farm for 6 years. We have grown mangoes in the fields. Now, we are growing mangoes in the fields. Sri Gandha is a very strong tree. It is a great fear for the farmers who plant mangoes. The trees that have been planted for 20 years, are being used as a means of destruction for the farmers. They also take time to work. So, the government should make a good arrangement for the protection of Sri Gandha trees. Today, all the farmers are afraid of the smell of the mango trees. They are afraid that if they plant mangoes, they will be used in the DC office, government buildings, and the forest. They will be afraid of how you will improve. We have asked the government to give us a subsidy for the pencing. We have given the subsidy to save the trees from the dogs and the cows. This is a soap factory in Maratha. This is a factory in Bengaluru. They have made an agreement. They have agreed to give us the subsidy for the pencing. But I have not made any other agreement. The profit of this crop is for the farmers. The rate of tomato plantations is not good. So, the farmers are suffering. The rate of the rate of the crop is not good. The rate of the crop is not good. So, the farmers are suffering. The farmers are suffering. The farmers are suffering. On the occasion of Lord SriShow subscribers come to the platform. in a distance of 1000 acres, this time is leaving its home. Even in Indu forest and Aranya area, the farmers are receiving all kinds of support from the farmers. In the first year, the farmers get 40,000 to 50,000 rupees per hectare. When farmers are buying the crops of the country, the farmers are forced to buy the crops of the country. We are promoting this in a program called National Ayesh Mission. Srikandha Belediyad is legalized. Any farmer can grow his own land in Srikandha Belediyad. There are no other opportunities. So, now they have legalized this. The forest department and the foresters have provided two funds to the farmers for the Srikandha Belediyad. We are promoting this internally. They are growing everything. In the last three years, we have received 40 hectares of Srikandha. Not for monocrop, but for inter crop. They have grown maval, cb, sapota. They are growing here. For the first year of Srikandha Belediyad, we give 40,000 to one hectare. For the second year, we give 10,000 rupees per hectare. In the last two years, we have given 50,000 rupees to the farmers. They have provided planting material and food. They don't have any other needs. The seedlings of Srikandha Belediyad can be found in the forest department. In our area, only in Hulimavu. So, the farmers have to get this from recognized farms. Or they have to get it from the forest department. Before getting it, they have to register it in our department. We have two websites, Fruits and Haseeru. They have to register the form there. We also issue them a work order. After that, they can take the seedlings from the NHP accredited or forest department. And they can plant it in their own land. So, the next process is to apply. We submit it to the right time. We deposit the subsidies through RTGS to their account. It's very simple. As simple as in our other departments or schemes. It is very simple to grow and get benefits from the department. In the majority of Kolaraj, the farmers can see that tomatoes, flour, potato starch, and other types of seeds are growing. Along with that, there is a lot of bluegrass. But instead, the farmers have these seeds. The price of blood, sandalwood, and other seeds is very high. For the last 8-10 years, the farmers have been showing the desire to grow more. The Indian farmer has been getting 100 rupees in aid for the construction of farms for three years. The government has paid the price for the construction of farms and the construction of the farm. The government has also given the right to the private sector to do the construction of the farm. Our area has been part of the community. We have raised more than 10 lakhs of money to the farmers. They are studying the education of the farmers. The current salary of farmers is 2000 rupees per kg. The farmers can grow more. It is a world of caution. We can plant a lot of seeds in our land. If we plant it in a proper way, it will be very good. We can plant it in a proper way. The farmers are planting it in the middle of the farm. Some are planting it along with the seeds. Some are planting it in the middle of the heart of the papaya. It is better to plant it with other plants. The farmers are now able to plant it in a proper way. The soap and detergent has been used by the farmers. The handicrafts have been used to plant it in a proper way. The farmers are now able to plant it in a proper way. There is no market. If you want to plant it in a proper way, you can do it in the market. We can give the standard rates. This is done as a few practice the farmers. This is a good solution for awaiting safety for two to three years. It is beneficial for farmers, We have a dripper in the water and we use it to make water. We have a chart for the amount of water and potassium. We give the amount of water and potassium to the people of Saraj. We give the amount of water and potassium to the people of Saraj. We give the amount of water and potassium to the people of Saraj. Oil is a very important resource. Water is used to make water. The work should be done after 3 years of the country. The economic recovery should be done after 8 years. Arvind Lingadalli has been recovering from 3 years of the country. He has been building 4 houses from 3 acres to 6 acres every month. He is also making a profit of 45 to 40 thousand rupees. This is our work. We have been doing this for 3 years. We have been cutting the grass for 2 years. It is recommended to cut the grass after 3 years. We have been doing this for 3 years. We have been installing the ground. The work starts after 3 years. We can continue to build 2 houses continuously. We are getting income continuously. The cost of the construction is less. We are cutting the labour. Arvind Lingadalli is in the farm. He has been in the farm for 7 years. He has been working from 3 to 48 tons. We know the number of tons. He has been doing long term crops. He has been working for many years. He has been doing this for 3 acres. I have started to work for 3 acres. I have been working for 3 years. I have been working for 3 years. I have been working for 3 years. Talaekrishi was the plan of the central government. It was a good idea to start this farm. The company has not taken any steps to pay the price. The farmers have not taken any steps to pay the price. Arvind Lingadalli has been working in Talaekrishi since the last 6 years. He has been doing well in the last few years. We have seen that the farmers have been working hard. Arvind Lingadalli has been working hard. We wish to see them working hard. This is Kamraman Vijay Kumar with Sankhan Gowda, Yama Devi Koppah, News 18 KAN, Haveri.

SandalWoodNewsStories_174,"Om Namaste. I was saying, you are coming as a special guest, I am a fan of yours. You are known as the Karnataka Sandalwood lady. You have been a mentor to many people in our financial freedom app and inspired many people. I first heard about you. A video of you was viral. You have been talking about how to grow sugarcane and other things. You have been talking about how to tell people. A video of you talking to a farmer was viral. When I saw that, I thought, how can they talk so well? They are not so good at talking. After that, you came to Weekend with Ramesh. Even when you were talking, I listened to your words. I told my team, Suresh sir came to your town and shot a video with you. Thank you so much for taking a course with our app. We are all your fans. Balasubramanian fans. You have been talking about your talent in Karnataka. I want to ask you a question. Many people know that you go to a man's house, you quit engineering, you reject the offer of work and you give up agriculture when you are alone at home. But today, many women have a problem. They want to do agriculture or something else. But home work is not over. You have managed well. How do you manage your work at home, get involved in agriculture and do so many things in agriculture? I work from 5 am in the morning. If I work from 5 am, the laborers will work from 6 am. If I work from 9 am, they work from 10 am. So I have learned to work from dawn till dusk. I work from 5 am in the morning. I start working from 6 am to 7 am. I have to make bread, vegetables, food and drink. I tell my daughters that we work hard and we get leadership qualities. We get lazy and we have to live like slaves. I request my daughters. I request my daughters. You have implemented leadership qualities. No one can stop you from becoming a boss. You will be active and your family will be active. That is why I request all the daughters to work from 5 am till 8 am. I sleep till 8 am. I am going to sleep at the show today. Otherwise, I will sleep at the end of the day. So I want to do it like this. Very nice. You have learned all these things in agriculture. If you want to learn this, of course, no one has done this before you. How did you learn this? My father used to say that I am lazy. I will do it like my father. How did you learn this new thing? How did you start to do this? I was raised by a man. I didn't know anything when I came to agriculture. I didn't know that he would come to eat food. I thought I would get it soon. I didn't have knowledge about it. But when I came to agriculture, I couldn't stop at this temperature. I went to Chakrabandha three times. That is the last temperature. It was 43, 44, 45 degrees. After coming to Chakrabandha three times, I couldn't control it. So I started to do it. When I started, it was not a fertile land. It was not a fertile land. I faced many problems in the beginning. I faced many problems. I faced many problems. I had to try something different. I didn't get any support. I had to pay Rs. 10000 for the last thing. I was very tensed. I had to change a little bit. I had a pomegranate in my hand. I have a lot of water problems. I didn't have water in my hand. I did a diet and I took pomegranate. I took a very good quality pomegranate. I took a good quality, even a King, Queen. I got a good rate. 180, 143, 153, 128. I got a good rate. But what happens, If you don't take water in the pomegranate. It is called Bacteria Blight Disease. I was also a victim of it. Many Dalambari people are confused about what to do with their health. After the disease, I was given 5 lakhs in advance. I took it back. Because the Chennai flood had come and sealed the area. What happened then? I had taken the money from the bank. The expectation was good. I had spent 30 lakhs on the flood. I had taken 50-60 lakhs. But the flood came and sealed the area. I was getting up in the morning and when I was holding the rock, the people who gave it were not asking for it. When I was getting up, everyone started asking for money. I had taken some money from the outside and some from the relatives. I felt like I was alive. I learned it in the school. When we asked for help, all the phones were switched off. Because everyone was fighting for their education. I was educated like that. I was living with the world outside. When he came home, he was talking about life. I was living with the world outside. I was doing something. I was studying and doing something. When I was taking the money, everyone was fighting. I was fighting and I was a victim to everyone. That is not my story. It might have been the story of all the Karnataka farmers. I had taken the money and started talking. At that time, I was also in a lot of depression. I thought about it. I was in a lot of depression. I was in a lot of pain. How did I get hurt? I thought about preparing a new system for all the Karnataka farmers. I thought about what agriculture can do in a small village. I was not aware that I was 100 acres. We were all small farmers. I was not aware of agriculture, hearty culture, agroforestry, animal husbandry. I tried to integrate all these things into farming. At that time, I had some experience in Dalimbet. This time, I gave some advice on Shri Gandhada's work. It is not Aranya Bele. Today, Aranya Bele is not a choice of the day. It has become the need of the day. Corona has already proved that. That is why, our history, our nature, our nature has become like this. When I first started to work on the good effort of the day, I came to know about Shri Gandhada. Everyone in Taurumani Darwada has a Shri Gandhada in their home. I was a part of Sadhan Keri. I started to study why I should not do it. I did IWST, Indian Wood Science Technology training. Everyone started to study it. They were very experienced. They were not able to do anything in the 45 degree temperature. They were not able to do anything. They were not able to do anything. I did not ask anyone. I asked my heart. I asked what I did. I knew that Shri Gandhada was going to be in a different ashram. That is why I did Dalimbet and worked on it. What I did this time was I did the daily wage method. Every day, the farmer should get the salary. In that day, the wages I did in 48 acres of land, in addition to that, 2500 Shri Gandhada, 600 mangoes, 600 pears, 450 sithapal, 100 bettu nallika, 100 water lily, 100 honey lily, 100 karibeu, 800 sagwani gida, 100 nugye kai, 100 koli sakani ke, jenu sakani ke, 100 kari ke, I did all these. Why did I do all these? The daily wage method. Every day, the farmer should get the salary. After 45 to 50 years, the farmer will not be able to earn money. Because the farmer will not be able to earn 1 lakh rupees per day in the AC room. He will have to sell his gun. He will have to walk in the cold. He will have to walk in the cold. Then, he will have two legs in his house. If he gets the rate, he will give 2000 rupees for 8 hands. If he does not get the rate, he will go to the cowherd and will not be able to talk to him. He will go to the cowherd and will request him to give him the money he has earned this year. He will come with his hands tied. Today, I am talking to you, but you should not think that you have not seen me. I have been through thousands of times. Now, I will put my faith in the two. Because when a person gets the money, he will be the one who is above. I have been trying to do this since then. Wow! I am very happy. I think everyone appreciates that. I think generally, you should not be like this. Because you are doing a job, you are experimenting. If you do it in your parents' house, if you do it in your parents' house, even if you are sleeping, it is easy to convince your parents. If you fail in one experiment in your parents' house, you will not get support from anyone else. You will face them there, start over, win, come back, not to your home, not to your village, you have become a hero for Karnataka. I think, amazing. That is amazing.",om namaste i was saying you are coming as a special guest i am a fan of yours you are known as the karnataka sandalwood lady you have been a mentor to many people in our financial

SandalWoodNewsStories_171,"cultures on all levels It has been for over 10 years It is not good to damage the plant. It is better to see carefully. You should not see any damage. Because if you are inside the plant, you will not know what will happen. You will be attacked by the borers. You should be careful. You should air-plug the plant. You should spray the plant with wax. The plant inside the plant will not get oxygen. The plant inside the plant will die. What will the plant do? It will give the pesticide to the plant. It will give the pesticide to the plant. We should not spray the plant with water. Because the water we spray inside the plant will give the plant a scent. It will give the plant a scent. The plant will become chemical. If it is a chemical, it will give the plant a pesticide. If it is a chemical, it will give the plant a pesticide. It will die. Who else? Did you get the organic fertilizers? Did you get the organic fertilizers? Can I put in organic fertilizer? Can I put in organic fertilizer? I have not put in nitrodefixing tree. I have already added. Can I put in organic fertilizer? What is the problem? For 3-4 years, when the soil levels were low, when the bears spread and the nutrients were not available the plant suffered. From 50 grams to 100 grams, If it is not a heart root, check it. If someone asks, see if it is a heart root. How do you know it is not a heart root? Normally, if it is not a heart root in sand root, it will keep on getting hurt. It is not smooth. If it is a heart root, it will start to crack. If the heart root is full, it will have more cracks. If you give the first clue, it will be a heart root. After that, you can check it with an implement borer. Now, we have a machine that is an electronic domo. We use that and pass a small current through the tree. When we pass the current, it moves in the tree. We capture it and run it in the computer. It is a heart root, but it is not a heart root. It is not damaged. It is not damaged. It is not damaged. We can use it as an invasive, non-damaging or non-destructive method. It has been 6 years. It has been 8 years. We have to check the heart root. What can we do? It has been 8 years. We can't do anything. But we can't do anything to it. We don't know how to induce the heart root in the tree. Generally, we say, Why do we put this tree in a place where the soil is less? We will stress it out. What happens if we stress it out? The heart root will start inside. There is a belief in the literature. But we don't know how to stress it out. The stress is the reason for the heart root formation. What we do is, We disturb the root area. We touch the root. If we are disturbed, the heart root formation will be affected. Water will be less. It will be more distal. All these things induce the heart root. But we haven't got the correct literature proof. We have to listen to what you all have to say. Usually, when we go to dry land, the heart root formation is weak. It is 1000% more. But when you go to Malar Chimmanu, there is a lot of vegetative growth. The heart root is less in the north. It is less in the south. This is the way to stress it out. We have to stress it out. For the past 5 years, this is also a dead tree. It is a nimbus. The house is also dead. Investors are preparing for it. They have supported this tree for the past 10 years. Any fruit trees, that you can find in the local, are good. There should be a plan. This is the plan for the past 10 years. I have established an astrological plan. I have to know the exact plan. I will tell you the exact plan. I will tell you the exact plan. But, you have to decide the distance before checking the report. If you go to Tiptur, the coconut tree, it will be 20 feet away from you. If you go to Chimmanur, in Mallad, the distance is less. Do you understand? In Tiptur, the coconut tree is there, but if you go to Chimmanur, the trench is there, and the water is excessively high. I mean, the people should not be afraid of the situation and should not be afraid of the situation that the people are in. I am talking about the universe. You can't do anything about it. If you can do something less, you can do something more. You can do something more. You can do something more. You can decide the distance before checking the report. What happened? Did you do any protection? Did you come to the forest? Did you come to the forest? How many years did you stay? How many years? From 6 to 8 years, the Heartwood Formation was initiated. The Heartwood Formation was initiated and you were able to grow Heartwood until the age of 15. After 15 years, you will be able to get more profit. But, you will be tight there. You will be in a tight situation for a few days. You will be in a tight situation for a few days. That's why we are asking you to stay for 15 years. You can save at least 12 years and you will be able to get 10 kgs of Heartwood from the entrance. Okay? Now, you have to sign up with KSDL to know the MOV procedure. After signing up, they will contact you and give you a filing permission from the Forest Department. I have done this. RTC. RTC is Entry Regulation. You have to enter the Sandwood Belly first. They will ask for the proof. After that, they will give you a filing permission. After filing the case, they will go for an harvest. The harvesters will give you the food with moisture content. They will give you the amount of food. After that, they will dress you and give you the food. They will give you the food, the driver, and the category. They will give you the category that suits you. They will multiply that category. Suppose you are a heavyweight, the average category will be 6,000 rupees. The last category will be 12,000 rupees. They will give you the amount. There are many challenges. You can find out. For that, you can join the Raitra Association and attend the morning meeting. Last year, in November, we had a discussion and we agreed to the classification of the forestry industry. That classification was for the trees that grew in the forest. In the country, there are no trees that grow in the forest. We don't need this classification. We need to do four classifications. One is for the stem, one is for the root, one is for the sap, one is for the dust, and the other is for the bark. We need to fix the rate for these four classifications.",cultures on all levels it has been for over years it is not good to damage the plant it is better to see carefully you should not see any damage because if you are inside the plant you will not know what will happen you will be attacked by the borers you should be careful you should airplug the plant you should spray the plant with wax the plant inside the plant will not get oxygen the plant inside the plant will die what will the plant do it will give the pesticide to the plant it will give the pesticide to the plant we should not spray the plant with water because the water we spray inside the plant will give the plant a scent it will give the plant a scent the plant will become chemical if it is a chemical it will give the plant a pesticide if it is a chemical it will give the plant a pesticide it will die who else did you get the organic fertilizers did you get the organic fertilizers can i put in organic fertilizer can i put in organic fertilizer i have not put in nitrodefixing tree i have already added can i put in organic fertilizer what is the problem for years when the soil levels were low when the bears spread and the nutrients were not available the plant suffered from grams to grams if it is not a heart root check it if someone asks see if it is a heart root how do you know it is not a heart root normally if it is not a heart root in sand root it will keep on getting hurt it is not smooth if it is a heart root it will start to crack if the heart root is full it will have more cracks if you give the first clue it will be a heart root after that you can check it with an implement borer now we have a machine that is an electronic domo we use that and pass a small current through the tree when we pass the current it moves in the tree we capture it and run it in the computer it is a heart root but it is not a heart root it is not damaged it is not damaged it is not damaged we can use it as an invasive nondamaging or nondestructive method it has been years it has been years we have to check the heart root what can we do it has been years we cant do anything but we cant do anything to it we dont know how to induce the heart root in the tree generally we say why do we put this tree in a place where the soil is less we will stress it out what happens if we stress it out the heart root will start inside there is a belief in the literature but we dont know how to stress it out the stress is the reason for the heart root formation what we do is we disturb the root area we touch the root if we are disturbed the heart root formation will be affected water will be less it will be more distal all these things induce the heart root but we havent got the correct literature proof we have to listen to what you all have to say usually when we go to dry land the heart root formation is weak it is more but when you go to malar chimmanu there is a lot of vegetative growth the heart root is less in the north it is less in the south this is the way to stress it out we have to stress it out for the past years this is also a dead tree it is a nimbus the house is also dead investors are preparing for it they have supported this tree for the past years any fruit trees that you can find in the local are good there should be a plan this is the plan for the past years i have established an astrological plan i have to know the exact plan i will tell you the exact plan i will tell you the exact plan but you have to decide the distance before checking the report if you go to tiptur the coconut tree it will be feet away from you if you go to chimmanur in mallad the distance is less do you understand in tiptur the coconut tree is there but if you go to chimmanur the trench is there and the water is excessively high i mean the people should not be afraid of the situation and should not be afraid of the situation that the people are in i am talking about the universe you cant do anything about it if you can do something less you can do something more you can do something more you can do something more you can decide the distance before checking the report what happened did you do any protection did you come to the forest did you come to the forest how many years did you stay how many years from to years the heartwood formation was initiated the heartwood formation was initiated and you were able to grow heartwood until the age of after years you will be able to get more profit but you will be tight there you will be in a tight situation for a few days you will be in a tight situation for a few days thats why we are asking you to stay for years you can save at least years and you will be able to get kgs of heartwood from the entrance okay now you have to sign up with ksdl to know the mov procedure after signing up they will contact you and give you a filing permission from the forest department i have done this rtc rtc is entry regulation you have to enter the sandwood belly first they will ask for the proof after that they will give you a filing permission after filing the case they will go for an harvest the harvesters will give you the food with moisture content they will give you the amount of food after that they will dress you and give you the food they will give you the food the driver and the category they will give you the category that suits you they will multiply that category suppose you are a heavyweight the average category will be rupees the last category will be rupees they will give you the amount there are many

You have been trying to grow your own crop for 22 years. Tell me about your background. I have completed my second PC. I have completed my IT in that paper bag. I have been thinking about my business. I have a lot of desire to get the right amount of money. How much land do you have? We have 18 acres of land. We have 10 acres of land. We have 10 acres of land. We have 10 acres of land. How many people do you have at home? We have 5 people. I have my brother, my father and my mother. How do you manage to earn money? I am the one who is able to do the most. I am the one who takes care of the rest. Why did you start IT and then start farming? I am not able to live without it. I have seen the freedom app. I am interested in it. When did you subscribe to it? I have been wanting to subscribe since the beginning. When I got the luck, I got a premium of 3 years. How did you watch the courses? I watched the courses and I was able to get time. Which courses did you watch? I watched the Dragon Fruit, Paper Plate, Sree Gandha Dho Bagina and Dalimbe. I have seen the course. When I watch the Dragon Fruit course, I will learn something. You already have a lot of knowledge about agriculture. You have seen the agricultural land from a young age. You have seen how they get their crops. You have all this knowledge. How did you learn about it? I have learned about it. After that I have seen the land that is not suitable for farming. I have learnt to cultivate it. I have not changed much. I have learned about it. After I have learnt about it, I have not changed much. It is an attraction for the campers. They can observe water.

What can be done? How can a farmer be helped? A farmer can be helped a lot. But the change is that a farmer can see the loss of profit from other businesses. But a farmer can't see the loss of profit. Because a person who has no land, can't look after other people, can't look after them, can't look after themselves, and can't look after his family. From the course you have seen, you can't be with your brother or father. You have to tell him about your knowledge. You have to tell him to do this and that. Can you tell us about that? I have been working for more than 10 years. I have been in a lot of loss since the last 3 years. I have been in a lot of loss due to Corona. And I have a lot of flow.

SandalWoodNewsStories_172,"music I have come to a farm. In this one acre area, I will show you how much trees are planted, how they are fed, and how much profit is made from it. But before that, let's see the BMM farm. Tadaaaan! So this is the BMM organic farm. Here in this one acre area, 200 trees are planted. So let's see how it is done. Here, they have grown crops for water. If something happens to the water, it will help the farmers to get water from here. As you can see, there are many trees. The trees are very strong. The specialty of this farm is that the trees cannot be planted on their own. So, if you want to plant trees, you need to have a special plant. If you have a plant nearby, it will be alive because of the plant's energy. So, if you plant trees, you cannot plant them on your own. So, I want to support that. Only then, the trees will grow well, and your Srikandha tree will grow well. There are 15 varieties of trees in the world. But India has the Australian sandal. The Australian sandal has two sides. It is the best in the world. Especially, the Indian sandal is very expensive. So, we thought, if we do this agriculture, we will be very profitable. In 2001, we noticed that even if we plant trees, the government would have taken over. But now, the government wants to promote this. If you plant sandal, the Srikandha tree will grow well. But, the government will take over. So, even if you plant one tree, the government will not register it. But, you can grow this tree in your farm. If you do this as your children, usually, if you plant this tree for 30 years, you will get a lot of money. But, unfortunately, we are not taking any scientific methods. If we take all these, we will get good food. In 15 years, we will get that profit. In 30 years, in 15 years, in 30 years, we will get profit. So, now, we are seeing these trees in this farm. These trees have been planted for 2 years. So, it has been 2.5 years. It has been 3 years. We can see these mixed trees here. If you look at the trees that have been planted for 10 years, they have grown well. They will get at least 3 crore rupees. At least. Because, the rates will change. But still, when we cut the trees, we will get soft wood. That's why, there is not much of a difference. But, in the middle, there is a difference. If you have a tree that is 2 feet tall, you will get 70 to 80 kg of hard wood. But, the difference is very big. So, another thing is, our Karnataka oil is being used by the government to make our oil. Do you know how much it costs? 1 kg oil costs 5 lakhs rupees. Just imagine, half a gram of oil costs 2.5 lakhs rupees. One gram of oil costs 5 lakhs rupees. If you are doing this farming, you have to feed the tree for 1 to 2 years. Because, when you are young, it is difficult to grow a tree or a fungus. If you are just feeding it for 3 years, you will be able to grow a tree in 10 years. You will be able to live with a guarantee. If you are just feeding the tree, it will not grow. Because, it will only grow. So, you need to have another tree. You can use a host plant. The tree will slowly start to grow. The tree will grow and the tree will grow and the tree will grow and the tree will grow And even the tree will grow. This is not an street. You need to have a safe environment. And we need to notice what we are growing in here so we do not grow areas away from grass. Because, sunlight is vital in the diminishing of energy. Even the mushrooms If you want to plant a big tree, you have to wait for at least 2 minutes to see the result. When you see the tree, you want to plant it too. But before thinking about the tree, you have to think about the consequences. Planting the tree is not a big deal. Looking at the tree is not a big deal. You can do everything. It is a big deal to save the tree. When the tree is in a situation of cutting, the rock is very strong. So your security system should be strong. You have to invest a little in this after the tree is cut. There are many options for this. There are CCTV cameras, fencing, solar fencing. You can see how to protect yourself. You can also plan your area and your budget. You have to save yourself from the rock. Because if you cut the rock, you will have to go through a lot of trouble. Another thing we can see is that you can put a chip in the tree. You can control the chip from the forest department. So even if someone cuts your tree, you can find out where the tree is. This is how we first start the Srikanth plantation. How is the place we start? How should the security system be? We have to first know this. Then we have to know how to get the trees. How to feed them? How long can we get the trees? We have to look at it very carefully for 3 years. We will definitely give you another chance to do this. When you are young, you have to learn every method. If you start this, you will definitely grow a tree for at least 10 years. If you grow a tree, you will definitely get a good harvest. In our Freedom map, we can see the Srikanth organic farming course. They start farming. When they start, they don't have money. They change the money they earn to buy land. They start farming. They are very happy. Another thing is that this farm is their farm. I will tell you how they started their lives, how they spent their time, and how their life has changed. I will tell you about each one of them in the next episode. I gave you this practical experience. This BMM farm is my favorite. But how they started their life, how hard it was for them, what happiness they had. If you are young, you will definitely become a millionaire. You will definitely get the best of the best. You should also try to understand their journey in the next episode. If you try to avoid what they want to do, you will definitely get a lot of profit. I will see you in the next episode. Till then, take care. Don't miss an episode. If you miss this series, you will be in a loss. Bye. Do you have money to buy land? No, ma'am. I don't have money. I don't have anything. I can earn at least one lakh. I don't earn as much as I can. I will trust Sudheer sir and do this. I will plan to get him married to someone. Copyright © 2020 Sudheer Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

We could have done it in Marathas, but we had to give it to the government. Now they're saying that we can do it in Marathas, but they've given permission from the government. We know that there's a lot of demand for savaravika in other countries. We know that the government has enough space for the government and the government has enough space for the government. After the 15th year of the Mehlapatta, Sri Gandhar has been doing well. He said that the 15th year is needed. Before that, Sri Gandhar didn't say anything about that. He said that the 15th year of the Mehlapatta has been doing well. In our videos, we know that the people who took up this issue are white. There's a good price in the market for the 15th year. Do you believe that this is the price for the 15th year? They say that the current market is 16,000 per kg. Since 10 years, it's been 16,000 per kg. They say that the demand for savaravika is increasing. We're doing it in that way. We're doing it with the desire to get it. There's a land of 5 acres. Do you think that the land will be filled with savaravika? They don't think so. In groups, Sri Gandhar can do it. In the market, Sri Gandhar can do it in one or two acres. In the rest, he can do it in different areas. We have to look at their financial situation. We have to look at their financial situation. It's good to do what is possible for them. 2 acres or 3 acres. Do you think that diseases will come? The disease is that the hill is very high. It's been very high for 3 years. After that, there won't be much disease. We've come to this point because we've experienced it. Now, the weather is getting worse. The clouds are getting worse. We're trying to do some drenching for the weather. We're trying to do drenching for the weather. We can't do anything about the clouds. We're trying to do something else. There's a problem with the forest. You've done it in the forest, right? Yes. Is there any change in the forest? The forest has been very big until now. Now, the forest has become smaller. The trees are getting worse. The government has given us a chance to grow in the ground. The land of Karnataka is getting very good. It's getting better. We've started to grow in the forest. What's good for us is that we have to be patient. We're all farmers. When the sun rises, the power of the forest is... What's the problem with the rain and wind? The power of the forest is getting worse. We have to maintain the trees within the forest. We've decided to do it. Because of the heavy rain and wind, the trees are getting worse. We're trying to maintain the trees within the forest. We've decided to maintain the trees within the forest. We're trying to maintain the trees around the forest. Is it a problem to have a forest near the Reshmi fort? No, it's not a problem. We're going to build a forest for 20 days. We can go there, but we won't go there. Because the forest is the most important for Srikanth. We're going to build a forest for 20 days. We'll build a forest near the Reshmi fort. We'll build a forest near the Reshmi fort. Because the forest is the most important for Srikanth. We'll build a forest for 20 days. That's what they say. We're going to build a forest for 20 days. What is the protection of Srikanth? When it comes to the protection of Srikanth, as many people say, we're using microchips. They say it's a very primitive technology. If the government gives us a solution, we'll be able to use microchips. We've been doing this for three years now. We'll be able to use microchips, and we'll be able to take care of the dogs, and we'll be able to take care of the people. We'll be able to use cameras. We'll do everything we can. We'll do everything we can. The government should also help us. Because the government has a tax system. If the government helps us, we'll be able to do this with more effort. How do you plan to build a forest in the future? It's been a long time since it started. It needs 20 years. The market is expanding. They say it's a great way to work. It's getting more expensive every year. When we look at it in that way, we think, what is this? You've been buying alcohol for a while now. Even private book? It's a good thing. Because if we give it to the government, when we have an open market, even if we don't buy alcohol, when we open it, we'll be able to see the price rise. What is the export rate of alcohol in the country? We don't know much about that. They say there is a demand for it. They say it's becoming a market. In Australia, they give it to the poor. We've heard that. We get it in Australia. We get it in Australia. We get it in Srikanth. But we don't have it in Uttarakhand. We don't know much about it. Have you found any trees? We have found some trees. We used to do that in the past. It used to be good for the wind and rain. We do that in the morning. We used to collect as much as we could from the forest. We used to do that in the morning. We used to do that from the morning. Some of them are good. But we are still doing it. What about the seeds? We have been collecting seeds for 3-4 years. When we get enough, we will harvest it. We will get it from the buyback system. We get it in kgs. They say it's around Rs.200. We will get it. There might be an wearable tree. I'm afraid it might die. Is it a problem for the farmer? No, we haven't found any problem till now. We just need to see what happens in the future. If we can get the chepai tree down and come up, it will be a problem. We have to work hard to get the chepai tree to grow. It really looks good, but one day the food will fall and the end... Then who will do it? It depends on how peopleやって. It is good to plant a mixture of rice and rice. It helps the farmer and our life. So, we plant a mixture of rice and rice and grow Shrikandha. I think it is good. We have grown Shrikandha in the Chepa Gidu. When we were in Chepa Gidu, we had a seeding plant. Is there any problem in the seeding plant? I think it is better to plant Shrikandha from the government. They have planted the seeds from Kerala. The seeding plant is doing well. We have to get the seeds from other places. But, we are not getting them. Some people have planted seeds in other places. We are not getting the seeds from other places. Do you have a waiting period for the seeds from the government? They usually book seeds in June and August. They book seeds in June and August. We have to pay Rs.3 for the seeds. Yes, we have to pay Rs.3 for the seeds. The price of the seeds is high in the Kasi Gia nursery. They charge Rs.50 for the seeds. We have to pay Rs.50 for the seeds. We have to pay Rs.50 for the seeds. But, the seeds are not good. We have to pay Rs.50 for the seeds. Do you need permission to go out from the government? We have entered the government in Pani. We have given the seeds to the government. They have entered the government in Pani. We are trying to fulfill the government's wish. We have to fulfill the government's wish. We have to give the government 20 years. We are trying to make the government join hands with the government. Do you think the government should be the one to give the seeds? No, we have to give the seeds to the government. We have to get permission from the government. We are doing the same. If we purchase the seeds and give the right price, we will get a better government. We will get profit from the government. We have to keep the government under our control. We have to give the government a good revolution. We have to give the government a good revolution. We have to give the government a good revolution. We have to give the government a good revolution. Do you think the government will allow it? The government has given permission. We have given the government permission. We have given the permission to go out. We don't need the government's permission. We have to give the government a good revolution. We have to give the government permission. We have to give the government a good revolution. Do you think the government will give you subsidies? We don't have to get subsidies. But we have to pay for the education. In the blink of an eye, I came to see the farmers. We know the government has given us the benefits. We went from there for 3 years. Ikka Kurhehe Kovadai and Gyaratingmeda are unknown. Because it has been 3 years. The farmers are doing very good. We have heard that in Amaraj, Mysore and Bangalore, it is very good.",partners insight section isnt understanding ioo double equality anteverybody wants to be real counter think actually toively here

SandalWoodNewsStories_229,"Music Welcome to Kavishti! I am Vijayalakshmi Shibhar. We have all been standing still since the time the wild animals died. We have been living in peace, thinking that all the bad smell of our country will be gone. But let me tell you a story that will make us feel peaceful. In the Bangalore forest, they are trying to steal the smell of crores of rupees. But let me tell you a story. One day a distant forest came. It was a forest of the people who love the environment. They made a strange dream in our mind. That is, in the Bangalore forest of the world, crores of rupees are being stolen by the holy forest. They thought that they were making a cover story. At first, they thought that they were making fun. Because in a concrete forest like Bangalore, where should the smell of crores of rupees come from? But they worked hard and stole the wealth of the country. Please don't get angry and go to our house and open your eyes. After listening to their story, they started their journey to Jnanabharati. The people who love the environment welcomed us. They were excited and they took us to the Bangalore university campus. The forest here is in a very bad shape. The campus is in a very bad shape due to the plastic waste. The trees here have been destroyed by the wild animals. But we don't have any trees here. But we don't have any trees here. So, the disaster started in our mind. But our disaster was destroyed when we entered the Jnanabharati forest. Because we were surprised here. We were surprised to see the views here. The trees of the holy forest were destroyed here. Yes, crores of rupees are being stolen here. You can get the trees of the holy forest from the temple. The dead trees are being destroyed. These trees are being destroyed. These trees are being destroyed. There is no security here. Sri Gandha is the pride of our country. We call it the Kirti of Karunada. But the wealth of the forest is being destroyed. The dead trees are being destroyed. The trees are being destroyed. The trees of the holy forest are being destroyed. They plant the trees in the night. They plant the trees in the night. There are so many trees there. You can see the trees there. But you have been here for a day or two. Why are you so happy? I am not happy. I am happy because I have been here. I am happy because I have been here. Is it? Yes. In a time, the Bengali people were living in the forest. This was a special property for the animals. This was known as the holy forest. Because there were so many holy trees here. In the 80s, there were so many holy trees here. Sri Gandha was always full of holy smell. This is what the professor reminds us of every day. I came to this campus in 1983. Since then, there has been no holy tree here. The number of trees that are visible in the sky is the same. I think the university should give priority to this. This is a smelly tree in Bangalore. We have protected the top priority tree. That is why the university is growing so much. It is growing like a crop. But now, the smell has spread in the smelly area. Sri Gandha is like a milk of stones. Every day, at least two to three trees are sacrificed for the stones. It is not a curse. The roadside is so bad. There are so many inside and outside. I am just trying to make it work. There are even small walls. All of them are like a tree. They are cut and left there. They are left for a week or two. Then they are cut into small pieces and taken away. But the environment department of the biopark is trying to make Sri Gandha sing. The study accuses that they have come to the south and are trying to make the smelly tree sing. It is so easy. We are standing on this road and there are so many street lights. They will hit us with stones. There are 33 private security guards in Bangalore. They are not paying attention. If they hit us with stones, no one will listen. When we see the smelly trees in the forest, we get shocked. When we walk around the area, we can see the stones. The stones are not hidden here. They are made of wood and are used as a tool to steal the precious things. There is a machine in the forest. They use it to kill people. They use it to kill people. No one listens to us. When we see the machine, we feel like we have come to the forest. If they come and cut us, we will be involved. If we are involved, we can't do anything. There is a lot of smelly trees here. If we write that there might be a lot of bad smelly trees, we will get a good answer. Because the smelly trees have been stolen. No one has been harmed by the world's science. They have built a new plantation. There is a valley between the first building and the second building. They have built a sandalwood plantation in that region. It is very nice. They have built a committee. They should replace the committee with sandals and sandwood trees. They should get a general suggestion. If you see a bad smelly tree and steal the precious things in its corner, you are in the world's science's deep sleep. The planet's science is holding hands. There is no information in the second area. When the smelly trees are being killed, our police force is sleeping. Or is it their doing? I will answer all these questions after a short break.",music welcome to kavishti i am vijayalakshmi shibhar we have all been standing still since the time the wild animals died we have been living in

in the forest this was a special property for the animals this was known as the holy forest because there were so many holy trees here in the s there were so many holy trees here sri gandha was always full of holy smell this is what the professor reminds us of every day i came to this campus in since then there has been no holy tree here the number of trees that are visible in the sky is the same i think the university should give priority to this this is a smelly tree in bangalore we have protected the top priority tree that is why the university is growing so much it is growing like a crop but now the smell has spread in the smelly area sri gandha is like a milk of stones every day at least two to three trees are sacrificed for the stones it is not a curse the roadside is so bad there are so many inside and outside i am just trying to make it work there are even small walls all of them are like a tree they are cut and left there they are left for a week or two then they are cut into small pieces and taken away but the environment department of the biopark is trying to make sri gandha sing the study accuses that they have come to the south and are trying to make the smelly tree sing it is so easy we are standing on this road and there are so many street lights they will hit us with stones there are private security guards in bangalore they are not paying attention if they hit us with stones no one will listen when we see the smelly trees in the forest we get shocked when we walk around the area we can see the stones the stones are not hidden here they are made of wood and are used as a tool to steal the precious things there is a machine in the forest they use it to kill people they use it to kill people no one listens to us when we see the machine we feel like we have come to the forest if they come and cut us we will be involved if we are involved we cant do anything there is a lot of smelly trees here if we write that there might be a lot of bad smelly trees we will get a good answer because the smelly trees have been stolen no one has been harmed by the worlds science they have built a new plantation there is a valley between the first building and the second building they have built a sandalwood plantation in that region it is very nice they have built a committee they should replace the committee with sandals and sandwood trees they should get a general suggestion if you see a bad smelly tree and steal the precious things in its corner you are in the worlds sciences deep sleep the planets science is holding hands there is no information in the second area when the smelly trees are being killed our police force is sleeping or is it their doing i will answer all these questions after a short break
SandalWoodNewsStories_230,"But in the Jnana Bharatiya campus, 14 km away from the Vithanasavudha chamber, the Hindu householder Ashok is getting beaten up by his wife. But the government is holding hands with him. What is happening in the area next to us is that, the police and the police are being abused. They should be beheaded. Because no one can do this. That is why they are being beaten up. They should be killed. If they are not allowed to work, they are being used as waste. They should be killed. They are parents. If we leave them, they are not parents. They are orphans. This is how we have become orphans. The place where the criminals were seen, is not at all safe. The police have kept them away from the area. But what is the answer to their legal efforts? There are 100 to 200 buildings. We have complained to the police. The police have told us to take them away. We have told the public that the police have told us to take them away. So many people are missing. We have checked the reality of their missing family. At midnight, we went to the VV campus. We ran in the place where the smell was. But no one asked us. From midnight, we ran around the campus for 6 hours. But we got a call from the Home Guard. When we spoke to them, we got to know some facts. We have no right to raid. We have no power to raid. We have no right to attack. We have no power to raid. We have no power to raid. We don't have to go to the place of the person who raided. We are nothing to see person's action. We are nothing to do. The trunks, cannot be seen well. He told that we should come home as fast as possible. We don't have to go to the place of a person painted with a touch. Even if we could protect ourselves, we are the Prime Minister. We cannot stay in that place unless it is fresh. We cannot build oil wells in summer. I don't know what to do. That's my problem. I have given him a lot of money to build a house. He didn't give him a single torch. He didn't give him the right to study. So, he doesn't know when his eyes will come out. He doesn't know how he will be. He is in a state of not doing anything. After every two hours, they are wearing black dresses. They are watching us. They come to the bank. They come to the bank. They will come after 12 o'clock in the morning. They will come after 12 o'clock. In the morning, they will pay attention. They will pay attention. They will come after 12 o'clock in the morning. They will pay attention. We are here like that. When they come, they will cut the machine. They will cut it quickly and then they will come. Madam, do we get the gram? Madam, first we will get the gram. They come from Nairandali. They come from Nairandali. What will they do if they are beaten and thrown into the river? There were 63 home guards in Vishwavidyanile. What can they do? There are only 5 entrances around Vishwavidyanile. But there are no check posts. During our reality check, police were checking vehicles on one side. But they were not checking vehicles coming from Vishwavidyanile campus. Our country, our forest, our wealth, are not loved by the people. This is not possible for the society. These officials and representatives are putting a board on the trees of Kilesakki forest and making them feel sad. It is a crime to cut these smelly trees. It is our duty to cut these trees. But the police and the university officials are forgetting their duty. The government should take a tough action against these officials. Otherwise, these smelly trees will be destroyed in the next day. I will come back with another story. Thank you for watching the show. We will meet again on the 24th. Thank you for watching.

SandalWoodNewsStories_242,"and has also opened up the Shrikandam in different ways. Even now, Shrikandam is a very important asset for them. Most of the Shrikandam's value is around Rs. 106 crores. Freedom App has also shown the way to increase the value of Shrikandam and earn crores of rupees. We saw the video and were very happy. It is easy to think that we should do this, but when it comes to the possibility, it becomes a big problem. And there is a lot of situation behind it. When did you decide to do this? In 2003-04, it was very hot in our area. In Chikmangalur district, the Taluk was in full bloom. In that area, in 1000 acres, the Adikey garden was destroyed. So, after the Adikey garden was destroyed, we were thinking of what to do in the rainy season. In the rainy season, the forest walls will be built. So, we thought of building a sagvani wall. Because the Adikey garden was completely destroyed in the spring. After the Adikey garden was destroyed, we thought of building a wall in the rainy season. We thought of building a teak at that time. With the teak, we got permission to build Shrikandam in 2001-02. We knew that from the government. So, we had an advertisement. If we build Shrikandam in 2011, it will be worth 1 lakh rupees for 10 years. We made an advertisement and started a protest. So, I thought of building a wall for Shrikandam. In 2005, I remembered my son's birthday. Shrikandam was 18. Today, it is 11 years. I am very happy. For 15 years, I built a Shrikandam tree. I got 1 lakh 80 thousand rupees profit. How many acres did you put? I started with 4 acres. Now, I have increased it to 44 acres. In the Freedom map, I have already told you how to build and how to save. They have already built it. You have told that you cannot tell the secret of success. You have told that you have to build and how to save. You have told that you have to save. So, you have told that you have to save. In that app? Yes, it is in that app. They have built that app and they will tell that no one will leave their secret to their son. But, the farmers have to build it. They have to build it more and more. They have to build the Shrikandam of Karnataka. Because, Shrikandam is very important in the world. They have to use it and build it. They have to use it and build it. From the perspective of Shri Mantra Ragali, I have told that one secret in this app. They have to use it and build it. Usually, we have to know the complete information about what work we have to do. It is very difficult to do something and to succeed in it is very difficult. So, when you have to do something, how important is the knowledge and knowledge? Definitely, when you want to do something, the teacher should be there and the teacher should be there. In this day and age, there is no one. Now, there are many white farmers. For example, there is a freedom app. From that, we can get complete information. How to build a dam? How to build water for the dam? How to build a coconut forest? How to protect it? How to provide the necessary tools for it? All these are enough information. If you understand and understand it, you can succeed. So, you have to earn crores of rupees. Do you have to get a license? How is that? There is no license for Srikanth building. In 2001-2002, the government has made it free. So, anyone can build it. There is a big restriction on the government to build it after building it. So, according to the procedure, we have built it for Rs.500,000. If we ask for permission to build it, they will give permission. So, the current budget is very high. So, the current budget is very high. So, the current budget is very high. So, the previous budget has also been announced. So, the previous budget has also been announced. In 2021 budget, Srikanth's law is being implemented. In 2021 budget, Srikanth's law is being implemented. In the next few days, it will be implemented. If it is implemented, anyone can build it and build it anywhere. So, we are not only getting the money from Srikanth, our country is also getting it. So, the tax that I am giving is not only for us, but also for those who purchase it. They get 32% tax, 18% GST, 18% forest development, and 20% IT. So, 32% tax. And in our country, in non-marathon, they get 22% tax from us. 10% supervision charges and 12% classification charges. So, 55% goes to the government. So, in non-marathon, if I get 1 crore, then it is a fine of 55 lakhs to the government. So, it is very difficult to get forest development. So, from the development, we can get a good forest for the environment. So, from the development of good trees, we get more air, more rain, more air for birds, more air for the nest. So, from all this, we can get our own forest for our own benefit. We can get our own forest for our own benefit. Moreover, we can get more forest for the environment. Because, for the birds, no one has built a house for them, so, we can build a nest for the birds as we want. But, we can't get the food for the birds. Even the food for the birds can be used for the food. So, from this point of view, we have a desire for the environment and we should all get out of it. So, I think. We have seen in other times that the profits are increased, the profit is increased, what are the variations in this? Because of the rain, we don't have any effort to get out of this. We should say that this is a kind of a good forest. We should not think about saving it, we should not think about the loss. Because, in the world of forest, there is a lot of demand for our forest. In the open market, it is for 35 to 50 thousand rupees per kg. So, the price of the forest is higher than the price of the forest in Karnataka. So, there is no problem of loss in this. When I did this, it was for 1.5 to 2 thousand rupees per kg. Today, it is for 12 thousand rupees per kg. Where? In the government rate. In the open market, it is for 35 to 50 thousand rupees per kg. So, in the open market, the rate is higher. So, the question is whether the rate will be lower. It will be more profitable. Sir, what should we do to see your course? So, download the Freedom app and in that, my Vishu sandal is called Vishu sandal If you type the code Vishu sandal, it will open in the Freedom app. So, you can go out. Okay sir, we have learned a lot of things. We have learned a lot of things. What questions are there? How to protect? Thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you also. In the Freedom app, the farmers will take this course and they will also work together. So, thank you also. Vishu Kumar, you can also see the course in the Freedom app. You can learn more.

SandalWoodNewsStories_305,"From this we can earn around 1,20,000 rupees In the private market, the price of this tree is around 10 to 15 thousand rupees This tree depends on the water and food needs of the tree If we look here, the tree is 5 feet tall and has a good height Greetings to all This is a very valuable tree It is famous in the world for its fragrance This tree is very popular in the national and international market But this tree is very popular in the market The reason is that the cultivation practice of this tree is very good We call this tree as a hemiroot parasite The structure of this tree is not developed properly This tree depends on the structure of another tree If you are growing in Srikanth, you need to find a host plant for this The reason for the formation of the tree is that it does not have the ability to take water, minerals and nutrients This tree depends on the structure of another tree If we look at the host plants for this tree First of all, agroforest trees Now there are aranya plant plants There is a hebe, tea, honey These trees can be given as a host to this tree The best host for this tree is mulberry We can also host other honey trees The host plant you are selecting should not be more than the tree in Srikanth Because the heartwood is very important in Srikanth So to form the heartwood and oil, it needs to be very hot and sunny If we select a very hot tree, it will give us heat Then the heartwood formation will not be possible In that we call the tree as a stress-loving plant If the tree is very hot and sunny, it will give us heat I told you earlier that if you want to form a heartwood or oil, it needs to be very hot and sunny So if you get all these, the tree will give you heat The distance is very important to plant a host plant So you need to plant a host plant after 3 meters from 2.5 The best host plant for this tree is leguminous These leguminous trees can also give enough nutrients to the tree There are two types of host plants One is primary host and the other is permanent host Primary host means that if the tree is in the starting stage, it needs to be planted for 6 months to 2 years Next is permanent host, which means that after 2 years we need to plant a permanent host If we look at the primary host, we can see togari, mutidare muni and sesbenia If we look at the secondary host, we can plant a permanent host, hibunerale, teak, honey, other honey trees We can also plant gliricidia Because of gliricidia and sesbenia, the soil produces more nutrients Because these two trees are very large trees, the soil produces more nutrients This is very beneficial for the skin of the tree If we want to plant this tree, we need to take another important ingredient This tree is a rain-capped tree For whatever reason, you should not plant this tree in a wetland Because I told you earlier that if you want to have heartwood formation in this tree You need to have enough light and moisture Otherwise, if you water too much, heartwood will not form This tree has a very low oil content If you want to plant a host plant in a tree, the water should not be too much on the top of the tree That should also be water-based Because if you water too much on the top of the tree, it will affect the host plant If you want to plant this tree, the space is very important Because this tree is a host plant, we need to give 5 feet of space to the host and the tree If you give more space than 5 feet, the water will not connect with the other tree It will be difficult to absorb the water and nutrients In the same garden, we will also show you that example If we look here, the tree is growing well because of the 5 feet space If you look at the other tree, it is not suitable for the use of the other tree Because the host plant is very far away from the host plant And it is not suitable for the use of the other tree We call this tree as wider adaptability crop Because we can easily plant this tree in any environment and soil If you give 10 feet of space to one tree, you can plant up to 120 trees This tree can grow from 15 to 20 years So we can get 20 kg of hardwood from one tree In the market rate, we can get 6,000 rupees for one tree If we get 20 kg of hardwood from one tree, we can get 1,2,000 rupees So if we get 160 trees per acre, we can get 2 crores of money from 160 trees In between these trees, we can plant papaya, lemon, cardamom, and cinnamon We can get that money from them But if we want to plant these trees, the main problem is that it can be cut We can get the cut and plant these trees So we have to protect these trees Because the production of these trees is getting less, the government is supporting the construction of these trees The Government of Karnataka has also started a project called Grow More Sandalwood To protect these trees, we have to remove the microchips This is a protection system from the government to protect these trees This is to remove the microchips and protect the trees We can remove the microchips from 8 feet of the ground to protect the trees This is done by Indian Wood Science and Technology So if a stone comes to your garden, it will capture images of drones, night vision cameras, day vision cameras The microchip has a server, which is connected to Indian Wood Science and Technology If someone comes to your garden, they will also receive a signal When you cut the tree and take it, you can track the tree But if you want to protect this protection system in your garden, you should have at least 100 trees in your garden But this is all dependent on the government If you want to do it yourself, you can remove a very sharp tree If the tree is too sharp, it will not be easy to cut it If the tree is 40-50 feet long, it will not be easy to cut the tree You can also use a fence to protect the trees You can also use a CCTV camera to protect the dogs in the garden If you want to buy a seedling, you can get it at a subsidy rate of 3-5 rupees You can also get insurance for the price of the tree There is also a lot of facilities for the animals If all the farmers in the village cut this tree, they can protect the trees You can cut the tree of this tree in any way you want This is adapted to all environmental conditions So, I think you should cut the trees in your garden and make more of them Since Dr. Soil has started to grow, I have grown a lot",from this we can earn around rupees in the private market the price of this tree is around to thousand rupees this tree depends on the water and food needs of the tree if we look here the tree is feet tall and has a good height greetings to all this is a very valuable tree it is famous in the world for its fragrance this tree is very popular in the

that after years we need to plant a permanent host if we look at the primary host we can see togari mutidare muni and sesbenia if we look at the secondary host we can plant a permanent host hibunerale

Then youths, day day and night would be slow in making assumptions. If day time and day time is difficult, Come and say us to step out and have gold coins, I will change my way of walking.

A youth with no problem in this farm can earn at least one or two thousand rupees a month and live a peaceful life. Greetings to all viewers. My name is Suresh Bab, Greenwood Farm. This is Kolaru. This Greenwood farm is located near KMF area. It is a greenwood farm located in Karnataka. This farm is 68 km from Bangalore. You can get a live video of the farm on YouTube, Google and Greenwood Farm. You can also get a live video of Sathya Sai Ruddha Ashram. It is located near KMF dairy. The farmers are losing their jobs because they are not able to pay their bills. So, we have decided to do a comprehensive agriculture in this farm. The main feature of this Greenwood farm is that there is no agriculture in our farm. We have adopted a very good agriculture concept. We have planted many kinds of plants, such as chicken, chicken, fish, country plants, forest, kitchen gardening, medicinal plants, agritourism, Ruddha Ashram, everything. We have adopted this concept so that we can feel the good atmosphere in the middle of the trees. In our entire agriculture, we get training from the villages of Karnataka, Gulbarga, Haveri, Kopla, Bidhar. We get training from there. The special thing about our training is that we have to learn at least 50% of our farm. What is there in our farm? We have to learn the methods to build the farm. And they learn from the theoretical concept that we provide. The theoretical concept is that we don't show the projectors or TVs. We explain to them directly what we are making profit from, what we are getting from the chickens, what we are getting from the chickens. This is our main focus. If I ask young people in Karnataka about their education, they should leave their parents' property and study for a degree in SLC or PUC and go to Bangalore to earn 10,000 rupees. After spending the last 10 years and saving a lot of money, I would like to send my message to young people who have left their land and their parents and are not living a good life. Please visit my farm once and if there is no zero-waste farm in this farm, you can earn at least 10-20,000 rupees a month. You can live a peaceful life. Today, you can invest 50,000 rupees and earn at least 10,000 rupees a month. You need a scientific method. You can watch this method on YouTube or watch a video on YouTube. But you need to know the meaning of the word and the meaning of the word. The farm I am doing is for youth. Youth means that we will be there and we will be the workers. We will have two cars in front of our house and we will have gold in our hands. We will have a change of style. This is what the youth think. I am asking the youth to please go there and become an office boy, delivery boy, security, P1 and earn 10,000 rupees, 15,000 rupees, 20,000 rupees. We have no borewell in our land. We are doing this only in the rain. We are earning at least 12,000 rupees a month. But I am doing this for the youth. I am doing this for the main workers. I am doing this for the teachers. I am doing this for the youth. This concept is for the youth. The farmer says that if the youth changes, the country will change. If the youth doesn't change, the country won't change. If the youth wants, they can do anything. The farmer says that the land will be like a well and the cattle will be like a cow. If the youth is there, the country will change. The concept of this concept is that we have all types of pet animals. We are doing this for the main commercial. We have chickens, we have a pig, we have a snake, we have 700 bloods, 600 bloods, we have 35 types of animals. We have lich, dragon fruit, moose, cow, coconut, jackfruit, palm, palm tree, all these are the concepts we have in our mind. These are all types of animals. We have built a farm in the village of Nysargi in Savaiyao. We get the grains and vegetables we need from that farm. We have a house with us, we have peace and happiness. We are a farmer who wants to do all these in a similar way. The youth can use our training and the farm. This is one of the characteristics of our farm. We call it a long-term crop. We have rice fields, we have to harvest rice. We have to harvest rice. We need to have the motivation to do this. We need to do this for the next 15 years. The farmers say that we should stay calm, we should keep investing. What do you say about this? It is very simple. We need to stay calm for 12 years. I am saying this as a zero-wage farmer. If you take a plant, the government will pay you 5% and give you the money for the maintenance. If you plant a tree, you can get a small amount of money. I am saying this as a small farmer. If you go to the market, if you buy a tomato for 20 rupees, you can get it for 2 rupees. If you buy a tomato for 2 rupees, you can get it for 1 lakh rupees. You should do marketing. When you do marketing, you will see the benefits. If you do marketing, you will see the failures. If you buy a tomato, you can get it for 40 rupees. We are farmers. We should build a market. The government should start the FPO, the Farmers' Producing Organization. People are not aware of this. Start marketing. The media is very popular. You can do marketing. You can do marketing. Every marketing method has a different tree. Every marketing method has a different tree. If you plant 4-5 trees, you will get a lot of benefits. I know that. You can't get any benefit from this. If you plant a lot of trees, you can't get any benefit from this. You can't get anything. You should be aware of what you can get. I know that you can plant a plant. You can plant a plant. You can plant a plant. You should be aware of this. If you plant a tree, you can get a lot of benefits. You can plant a lot of trees. So, you can get a lot of benefits. You can get a lot of benefits. People don't know about this. We have planted trees. We have a lot of benefits. We have planted a tree. This is not a method to get benefits. I have planted a tree. When you plant a tree, it will grow and develop. Now, I have planted shrigandha. I have added mulberry. I haven't planted shrigandha for 20 years. It will grow slowly. It is 1 kg. If you plant 600 trees, it will grow. You shouldn't take it for granted. I can easily do everything but I have a stem the purpose of giving stem to wood or play wood sheet minimum 10 to 5 thousand today we call it as Nihilgiri Mara Ne Iplikts that is taken for 4 thousand minimum 5 thousand I am told by Kadamaya Bela the minimum 5 thousand is taken for 1000 which is like me 1000 into 50 lakhs 50 lakhs in one time it becomes an amount it is like the sun is going to rise in the morning that is what I am telling our youth and people should be patient should take my car at night this is the concept in your content creation leave everything don't leave only one if you lose the tree, come back to the chicken if you lose the chicken, come back to the egg if you lose the egg, come back to the fish if you lose the fish, come back to the aranya if you lose aranya, make a small garden don't make a small garden make a small garden all these methods if you make a small garden and go to the market that is foolish you have to make a small garden and sell then you will get profit in every one in the market if you do content creation in every one in the content creation you should have a lot of knowledge now we are in dry land I have only put the trees that are needed for dry land trees that need water some people say to put agasa agasa needs more water but I have not put agasa what is needed for dry land I have put that I will put a bale on the top of the hill it will be flat in the base we will do silage in the base we will stock in silage in the rainy season we will open the base and put the logs we will have the logs we will see that there is a chicken in the stock going on what I am saying is in every one you should see the value what is the profit think only commercial people think agriculture is not commercial think only commercial think only commercial you can at least make a profit what the farmers are doing today there is a land it will be destroyed just put the wool how much effort is wasted if you put that effort elsewhere how many people some people come and go if you put wool the earth will not be good if you come and go you make the land the oil fields some people take the land after that do marketing all this is science if you are a big farmer do an EPO you need to have knowledge to give good content today the farmer producing organization our central government is doing this I am telling some farmers do an EPO I have put 200 farmers another 200 farmers should be made there is no awareness this is a concept what do you think about our content I have seen I have not seen in this soil I have not seen there are many fans many people call the people who come to your farm they call a lot they say we need training according to me they have come for training they are above 150 if you see south side you can see the farm but if you see our side no one does just watch the rain and see what happens next and watch the next rain from your channel I am ready to answer all the critical questions what else can I say some people don't know what is the difference between Raktachandana and Srikandana what is the difference Srikandana this is a Paravalambi plant without any support you need hosting what people do they come and say I have planted something you also do after planting Srikandana you plant Srikandana and then don't plant the plant plant other plants some plant Dwidala Dhani some plant mulberry some plant Nuggi some plant Haksa some plant Mahagani some plant Hebe some plant wrong both plants are weak Srikandana is a Paravalambi plant Raktachandana is not a Paravalambi plant Raktachandana grows individually Srikandana is going to the timber to the wood and to the soil the soil is getting into the soil as I said this is the angle of Srikandana Raktachandana is going to the wood as I know Srikandana is a good plant in the world the most costly wood is Hager wood it is very expensive we have training for Hager wood we give information about where to get Hager wood Hager wood is very costly in Karnataka in Karnataka we have training in a Royal Padu I have given 10 sashi of Hager wood they have planted it we have to inject it and do grafting but it is very costly what kind of weather do you need? normal weather is fine after the hunting we have to hole it and do some scientific methods and plan it in a proper way we need to use the right method for that how long does it take to reach Srikandana? if you are in a dry land minimum 20 years 15 years 20 years if you have some time it takes 15-16 years how much can you plant in one acre? one acre depends on the main plant or sub plant depending on that minimum one acre is from 250 another one is comfortable if you plant it in a proper way it won't grow this research is given by government schemes farmers are involved in government schemes there are some schemes all departments have brochures every training every week I tell them about all schemes IHR schemes all farmers should know after training we give them an authorized certificate if you want to make loans you can do it you will get benefits for example if you plant Srikandana in one acre how much can you see after 20 years? I told you if you plant 1 kg of Srikandana it will cost 16 lakhs if you plant it in oil it will cost more approximately 2-3 crores approximately from 2014-15 the government has given us a certificate so that everyone can plant in Kasgi land if you plant 10 kg of Srikandana according to our numbers you can't get it if you plant it once or twice you will get benefits if you plant it in 10 kg it will take 6-7 years if you plant it in 6-7 years then you will get clarity if you plant it in blood how much can you see after 20 years? same if you plant it in one acre it will take 200-250 years how much can you see after 20 years? same how much can you see after 20 years? if you plant it in Srikandana it will cost 1-2 crores approximately approximately that much we don't know what will happen next how can we use this herb? how can we see it? there is a scientific story this is called as Hallyi herb many people don't know about this this herb the herb is grown in the trees the herb when you plant it the taste is very good the stem of the tree is grown in the soil to make the tree the herb we plant now the taste of the soup is a little less than the country herb but in future the stem will not grow we can make the stem that's why we plant this herb except country herb the seed that has been crossed the government is giving we get it in private nurseries because of this herb when you plant it in the future you can plant the stem and sell it for the purpose of the tree the stem is also if you do the brokerage it will go to the level of the tree if you do the brokerage it will be a profit if you want to grow marketing is important that is the speciality of Hallyi herb sir finally about this herb and your training system what do you say to the youth sir, I always ask the youth please don't leave the property of the country as a dry land India is a country of the fields the country that is the main every youth instead of going to 5-10 thousand and getting all the money

SandalWoodNewsStories_184,"Namaskar Friends, today we are going to show you another important thing. We are going to show you how important is host and light for Srikant. Here our friend is showing you this. This is Srikant's 7th year. We have given host to this. This is not for maintenance, it is for the hostel. When we have host, you can see the surroundings. But the house on the right side is not a host. If you see the surroundings, the growth is very good. We have not given anything to this. It is just a natural house. If you see on the right, there is no host. See the growth difference. There are two 8 times built houses. If someone comes to this place, many people will know this place. We will show you more. You have to see what happens when you come in the sun. There are many walls in front of our hostel. But the walls that we have built are all single. But the growth is less. Why is this less? Because the main thing is that the sunlight is not getting properly. We will show you the same house in both the houses. The sunlight is getting and going up. But it is going around. It is going up fast. Because it is in competition. It is in the excitement of the need of light. This house is a light demanding house. So it does not get damaged. It goes up fast. People show that it is 10 feet, 1 year old and 20 feet old. It is not useful. It does not matter how high it goes. It should come around. Because the ratio of hot wood depends on the top. 30 to 70. You can see here. There are small walls. It is more than 6 feet. But it does not go around. Because it is in the under shade. Many people put it with 5 feet of mahogany. 450 mahogany and 450 srikand. Not one acre. 900 walls put in one acre. The children. I would like to say to them. Come and see our garden. Otherwise stop giving wrong information. Because the farmers are getting bad. I have no profit from this. We are telling them good things. We will give the sashi. But we are giving it less. One idea is to get good quality for the farmers. If you give good quality and if not, stop giving. Tell us that we do not know. Do not change everything. We should not take our lives to change your sashi. I am requesting you. If you have any problem with us. If you feel like we should not tell you. If you are not in college. You can ask us. We will see what we can do. You can change your sashi. Okay friends.

SandalWoodNewsStories_156,"So, the first question is, if you say that it is a tree of Sri Gandh, it is definitely different from other trees. What is the difference between this tree and other trees? That is our first question. If we talk about the tree of Sri Gandh, it is not like a normal tree. It is a hemiroot parasite. It is a tree that has been developed after the pervavvalambi. The special thing about this tree is that the heartwood is developed very well from fine grains. The color of the tree is very special. The heartwood is developed in the first ten to seven years and the oil of Sri Gandh is prepared and deposited in it. So, Sri Gandh is good for the Parimala and it has a medicinal value. It is good for the medicine and Parimala. It is good for the good health of the trees. Yes, it is good. That is the specialty of Sri Gandh. The first question that came to our mind was that we should have a Sri Gandh tree. We wanted the first one to be the Sashi tree of Gunnumatta. Where do we get these Sashi trees? The Sri Gandh Sashi trees are grown in our nursery. In the state of Aruniyalaki. In the Sashi Palanamalai of Aruniyalaki. We have grown the trees. This year we have grown more than 6 lakh trees. We have grown them and the people have grown them. The farmers have grown a lot. Yes, they have grown. This year almost all the trees have been empty. In our nursery, in Sashi Palanamalai, we don't get them now. But next year, this year we have given a lot of importance and enough publicity. But the demand is very low. There is a lot of demand. There is a lot of demand. So, I think that next year, this year we have grown 6 lakh trees. Next year, we are growing more trees. We are growing more trees for 20 lakh trees. You have planned it. Yes, we have planned it. Now we have a call. Nagaraj has called from Pawgad. Hello, Nagaraj. Hello, sir. We are calling from Pawgad. Yes, Nagaraj, please ask the question. How much trees can we grow in Sriganmura? The question was the same, Nagaraj. Now, how many feet should we make a tree in between? Nagaraj, we can make a tree in between 10 feet. When the tree is in between, you can decide the height. It will be different depending on the height. It will be different depending on the height. It will be around 400-435 feet. How do you make the soil suitable for that? Actually, we call this camp as loamy soils. Loamy soils, well-drained soils are best for this Sriganmura. But, all kinds of loamy soils are still growing. I have seen it in Nagarbarga. Even in black cotton soils, In all kinds of soil, it is still growing. Yes, it is still growing. Now, we have another call from Chitradurga. Kiran Navru has called. Hello, Kiran Navru. Hello, sir. Kiran, please ask the question. Sir, now we are in Chitradurga. Please ask the question. Being a M.L.C. graduate, B.Sc. graduate. Please speak a little louder. Sir, I am also a B.Sc. graduate. Is it? If you are also able to speak in your own language, it will be a great success. It will be a great success. But, actually, we have a lot of loamy soil. It is not suitable for shooting there. Loamy soil is not suitable there. As you said, there can be a camp ground, a big mountain, a sandy area, but it is not suitable for shooting there. It is not suitable for shooting there. Now, we have reached the end of the B.Sc. program. Now, we are going to start the program with the feeders. If we want to get the feeders ready, what feeders should be put in the beginning? We also give the feeders in 8 inches by 12 inches bags. It is good to make pits for it two by two feet. It is good for farmers' agriculture. They know it. It can be done by doing full farming and ploughing. Initially, we give the corn. We call it well-rotten farm-yard corn. It is better if we give compost corn. We give it two times a day. It is good for the growth. It is good for the growth. We have a host plant. That is very important. What are the fertilizers to be used? It is enough if you use a seed. It will grow. Another one is called a horn-guna seed. You can use it after cutting. Here, we have cashew nuts. It is good for the air. It is good for the air. Now, some people grow seeds in the field. They grow seeds in the field. It is good for the air. It is good for the air. It is good for the air. We can grow different types of trees as a crop. We can. Now, we can grow the leaves, the plants, the plants, and the plants. We can grow them. We can grow them. We have another host. They have made a first-come, first-served person from the seed. First-served person, namaskara. Namaskara, sir. Yes, ask the question. Sir, we want to be with the seed. So, what kind of rules are there? Regulations rules, protect... This is a good question, first-served person. How is the government's law now? In that situation, we should be careful. Because there was a rule that it should not be released. These things have been studied. Namaskara, Madhusudana. There was no ban on the release of the seed. There were no rules or regulations. There was no ban on the release of the seed. There was no ban on the release of the seed. Even before that, the seed was a state tree. It was a government property. In that time, in the land of Kasagi, in the house, in your place, if there was any tree, that tree was a government property. But when it was mature, we built it. Even then, when we built it, that was our depot, Sandalwood, Arunela, when we took it to Srikantada Koti, we used to dress it there. We dressed it and there was a price for each part. We used to pay 90% of that price in total. For the farmer. For the farmer. Before, we used to pay, but today, it is the same. But initially, Srikantada Koti was a government property. Now, we have completely settled it. It is in some place, it is their property. It is their property. So, there is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. We can get all the trees in our country. We can get all the trees in our country. Now, another question. Ashok has done this from Darwada. Ashok, greetings. Greetings, sir. Ask a question. We are talking from Darwada district. Ask a question. Sir, can we get this in Vanabhesha? Can we get this in Vanabhesha? We can get it, but initially, we wanted to get it in Neravari. In Vanabhesha, Srikantada is coming out well. Srikantada's growth. If it is good for the farmers, in the lower part of the West Indies, there is good moisture, there is good sunlight. It is good for the farmers. In Vanabhesha, we normally don't say that we are going to drip it in Neravari. We normally don't say that. So, in South Karnataka, it is good for the farmers. If it is in the fields, it is enough. In the fields, if it is in the fields, Srikantada is good for the farmers. Some people are planting it in the fields. They are planting it in the fields. Some people are dripping it. Some people are not. Srikantada is good for the farmers. In the North Indies, in the northern districts, I have seen in Gulbarga, in the northern districts, if the main crop is irrigated, there is good moisture. It is good for the farmers. One more question. How long will it take for a crop suitable for Maratha? for a crop suitable for Maratha? I have told you about it. From 7 years to 10 years, there is a brown-colored plant called Heartwood. There is a brown-colored plant called Heartwood. There is a brown-colored plant called Heartwood. How long will it take to grow? It will start. Since then, it is growing. For 10 years, approximately 1-2 kg Heartwood is available. For 10 years, approximately 1-2 kg Heartwood is available. For 15 years, it is different. It will stay in the soil. It will grow little. It will grow little. It will grow much. Heartwood formation It is not good for all. It is good for some. It is good for some. We can recognize it. If it is there, it is like a plant. If you look at it, you will know how much white it is. If you look at it, you will know how much white it is. If you look at it, you will know how much white it is. We will know when it is in the soil. For 15 years, it can grow from 4-5 kg to 10 kg. For 15 years, it will grow more. For 20 years, it will grow more. It grows more. Heartwood is growing. It grows more. Heartwood also grows inside. Heartwood also grows inside. If you grow it in more water, it will grow more. Inside, Heartwood will grow less. So, it doesn't require much water. So, it doesn't require much water. It is a good plant for the dry season. Until then, it will be slow. For another year, I think we will start harvesting. We may sleep until then. This is another plant. From Kohpala, Hanumareddy have made this plant. Hanumareddy, Namaskara! Namaskara! I am from Kohpala. Hanumareddy, Namaskara! Ask the question, Reddy. I am from Erayabhumi. I am from Makharani. I am from Erayabhumi. I am from Makharani. Yes, it is a rain based, a forest based.

trees that is our first question if we talk about the tree of sri gandh it is not like a normal tree it is a hemiroot parasite it is a tree that has been developed after the pervavvalambi the special thing about this tree is that the heartwood is developed very well from fine grains the color of the tree is very special the heartwood is developed in the first ten to seven years and the oil of sri gandh is prepared and deposited in it so sri gandh is good for the parimala and it has a medicinal value it is good for the medicine and parimala it is good for the good health of the trees yes it is good that is the specialty of sri gandh the first question that came to our mind was that we should have a sri gandh tree we wanted the first one to be the sashi tree of gunnumatta where do we get these sashi trees the sri gandh sashi trees are grown in our nursery in the state of aruniyalaki in the sashi palanamalai of aruniyalaki we have grown the trees this year we have grown more than lakh trees we have grown them and the people have grown them the farmers have grown a lot yes they have grown this year almost all the trees have been empty in our nursery in sashi palanamalai we dont get them now but next year this year we have given a lot of importance and enough publicity but the demand is very low there is a lot of demand there is a lot of demand so i think that next year this year we have grown lakh trees next year we are growing more trees we are growing more trees for lakh trees you have planned it yes we have planned it now we have a call nagaraj has called from pawgad hello

wellrotten farmyard corn it is better if we give compost corn we give it two times a day it is good for the growth it is good for the growth we have a host plant that is very important what are the fertilizers to be used it is enough if you use a seed it will grow another one is called a hornguna seed you can use it after cutting here we have cashew nuts it is good for the air it is good for the

SandalWoodNewsStories_159,"In the forest, there are trees, trees, and the sea. There, the trees are good. But when we look at Srikandhu, Benigada, Jaligada, when we look at this, our part is the best. Benigada is so good in our part, but it doesn't come in Mallinane. Jaligada, when it comes to us, it doesn't come in Mallinane. When it comes to us, it doesn't come in Mallinane. Even Srikandha, from there, it comes to us well. In our head. Because, why Srikandha comes to us well, because we don't want a big tree. There is another question. How big should Srikandha be to come to the forest? There is no linear relationship between the size of the plant, volume of the plant, biomass of the plant. Do you understand? There is no linear relationship between size of the plant, volume of the plant, biomass of the plant. That means, we don't need to be so big. You have given us water, everything, you have given us coconut, you have given us all the coconut. We don't know the difficulty of the plant. We have to see that. It is a plant that is not growing well. Now, it is more vegetative, luxurious growth. There is no secondary metabolism. The plant doesn't go in stress. What we need is not bark, not sharp wood, brown color inside, we need that. We need not only bark, but also a good moisture and high temperature. We need to have a low temperature and a high temperature. Now, the plant doesn't have a high temperature and a temperature of 38-40 degrees. What should we do? We should put a plant in the ground. There is no secondary metabolism. There is a temperature of 38-40 degrees. What should we do? We should put a plant in the ground. There is no secondary metabolism. There is a high temperature. Then, the plant will grow well. I will show you. The plant will grow well. Now, what should we do? Inside, the sharp wood, what should we do? It will kill the plant. We need secondary metabolism for that. It is nothing but defensive mechanism against drought. It is nothing but formation of art and accumulation of oil. Where the whistle is blowing, it stops the plant. It needs to live. It doesn't need to grow. It needs to live. It needs to live. It needs to live. It needs to live. It needs to live. What should we do? It stops the growth of the plant. It stops the growth of the plant. Now, the defensive mechanism is needed to live. It is called secondary metabolism. It is nothing but formation of art wood and accumulation of oil. It is nothing but formation of art wood and accumulation of oil. Inside, art wood formation is started. We call it church. But, if we take oil, we have to pay a huge price. We have to pay that price. We are afraid of people. What wrong have I done? They are lazy. They are not good. They are not good. Then, we have a burden. Then, we have a burden. So, we have to utilize the soil. So, we have to utilize the soil. So, we have to utilize the soil. The forest effects are different. We will see this. Blood circulation is not that bad. Blood circulation is not that bad. Blood circulation is like If you cross two trees, you should not do anything to the third tree. They will water the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the and then we will have a good harvest and then what is this today's government benefits and then in our country we get good harvest not only in mallinadi in mallinadi we get more vegetative growth biomass is more secondary metabolism is less there is a lot of waste the catch is less our plants are like this the growth is less the growth is more so we say there is no linear relationship between size of the plant and quantity of part of the plant when tourism turns green even with rotten native away there's no vax of Nathal Sabudha is the best is refusing to What is the relationship between the two? Definitely sir, it is a good relationship. It is not a bad thing, it is a bad thing. Because what happens is that, for one year there is no rain, for one year there is no rain, for one year there is no rain, for one year there is no rain, for one year there is no rain, for one year there is no rain, and above all nature has its own temperature, and that is the relationship. In this way, when we go to the forest, when there is no forest, the plant does not get stressed. Now it is less for the young. It was less for the young, but the secondary metabolism was better. That means, the artid formation was better. The oil accumulation was better. This year, when the rain was better, the gestative growth was more. In Malinand, if something happens, it is difficult. Artid formation takes time. When we go to Malinand, or when we go to Mathadu, we say that you need 20-25 years. Do you have any problem with the late arrival? No, you have no problem with the late arrival. What is your question? You have to come and ask. I will tell you to come at 9. What is your question? You have to come and ask. If you ask me, your question will be another question. If you ask them, they will ask, and they will answer. What happens here is, what we tell Malinand people is, that you need 20-25 years to get Srikandha. We cannot tell Bisul Naini. We cannot tell Bisul Naini. We are lucky to have you. The reason is, when we come here, after 10 years, we have 3 Ingari felakas. When we show them, we show them 3 Ingari felakas. 3 Mungari felakas. After 10 years, the Ingari Mungari is completely... We are lucky to have them. We are lucky to have them. We have 8 felakas. In 2 years, we will have 3 Ingari and 3 Mungari. 2 Ingari and Mungari. In 10 years, we have 8 felakas. In 2 years, we will have 3 Ingari and 3 Mungari. We will have them completely. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. They will be good. In 2 years, we will have Ingari and Mungari. After we get them completely, we will be happy, we will buy clothes, we will wash clothes, we will have them completely. Half of them will be dead. Half will be dead. We will do it till we are alive, and then we will be able to see the children who died in the past. We will be thankful to them. We will be thankful to them. That is the part. What happens to us here is this Srikandha is our host. Why is it our host? It is not just a place to come and go, it is a place of secondary metabolism. We have thought of it as early induction of artwood. We have thought of it as early induction of artwood. Now, today, we will listen to the experiences of the teachers and the farmers who were there. We will listen to their experiences. We should not be disappointed. We should not be disappointed. Then, we should be happy. We should be happy to see the children and to see them come fast. Brother, when will you be happy? Why do you keep that in mind? Will you be happy when you see them happy? We should be able to create a better environment for them. That is the building of Aseer Kaadan. This is not just a rock. This is a rock. We have economic life. It is not just about economic life. Along with economic life, we have a healthy life. We have a life of inspiration. We have a life of spirituality. You have built a wall, right? How much you build a wall, how many birds build a nest, take soil, build a tree, until they get their own security, they are blessed there. The three birds are together in the family. The birds are like a rock. The birds are blessed. The three birds in the family are together. If they are together, they can fly like a bird. They are called human birds. They are called birds. But if the three birds are together, they can see your life. You have built a wall, right? They can see your life. They can see your world. Where you have been blessed, your family, you have built a wall, they can see your world and pray to God. God, give health to this family. God, give happiness to this family. God, give peace to this family. The three birds pray to God for their own safety. God, give health to this family. God, give peace to this family. We put forward our efforts to the meditation. We didn't put forward ... Our efforts to the meditation. What do we do? The Sriman THIka is not one that is taken too far. It is one that is taken away. The bananaipati needs depth loving and Evanakita needs well having literally. He needs so much both as whatsoever is happening. So, it is a way of living a healthy, ideal and spiritual life. So, they say, KURSHITO NAASTHI DURBIKSHAM More than a million students, more than a million students, Another student said, In the same period, BELIEF, DRAHACHINTANAM They said that. But when it comes to agriculture, KURSHITO NAASTHI DURBIKSHAM To do good agriculture, KALIBILU NIM PAPA NIVANAKATANAM Our DASHINIKURU GNANIGALU So, Today, we decide, one, One, One, One, The best place to build a temple is our Govindaraj, Siddheshwara Swamiji, They take their words in their own words. Because, It is better to build a temple than 10 temples. Because, Since we have built a temple, there are up, down, caste, dharma, sun god, all that is there. When the storm comes, the temple does not have a compound anymore. There, Govindaraj, and many other priests are taking clothes for competition. The problem is, the lowly, that is it. But he is a gentleman. There is no point in asking. When he is taken to Govindaraj's school, these priests take him to the Garbh Gude. If a person is taken there, he will not be able to talk. This is our temple. But, these trees, they give air to everyone. They give food, they give shelter. They grow the leaves, the flowers, and the water. They give clean water. In this way, it is better to build a temple than 10 temples. In this way, how many temples have you built? The last one was... 450? 450. If you say 400 temples, 400 other temples are built. 900 temples. You will say, 900 temples are built. You will say, 900 temples are built. You will say, 900 temples are built. This is the truth. In this way, what happens is, this is a tree-based agriculture. And, it is a good harvest. Because, there is no chance of harvest. If you come to the forest, the law will be broken. And, from the last two days, you will notice that the law is different. You will learn different things. In this way, from the beginning, what we should do is, where we should go is, we should ask, what should we do to prevent the farmer from being killed? The shanayar will kill us there. Because, they have passed the exams. The secretary director and the shanayar have killed them there. They know. We are ready to take any other experience from our side. They have a strong will to work. They have built the dams for the law so that they don't get killed. They have built that dam. What we are lucky to know is, all these land is grown in the forest. The land is built for the forest. It is built for the forest. It is a treasure. It is a treasure. It is a treasure. I have also done this. I have done this. I have done this. I have done this. Someone, someone from the other side has done this. If we get good land, then our countryman has done this. Our average farmer does a good job. This way, the people from our side have done this. Everything is built here. What happens here? He has said to get good land. Or, someone has done this. The small farmer has got a good return. What have we forgotten? How much money will we get? I have forgotten. So, we call this a replicate. One acre is 100 acres, not 1000 acres. 1000 acres is 10000 acres. In this Bishulnand, if there were no trees, it would have been a land of the Malaynadi. Whenever the Malaynadi was built, the rain would have been heavy. When the rain was heavy, when the trees were good, the soil would not go down. The rice fields would have been like this. The water would have been given to the farmers. The rice fields would have been filled with water. When we were small, we used to drink water. We used to drink water to make us happy. Our children used to live like that. Now, when the Malaynadi people see our land, they should respect us. How beautiful is your land. Now, when we go there, the people of Kopal district, Raichur district, Ballar district, there are Bishul, Barthana, Dhula, Gulevai people. If we tell them about our district, they will get another picture. That atmosphere will change. That power is there. At the same time, if there were 1000 acres, it would have been 10000 acres. Then, the problem arises. The area has increased, the market has gone down. The sandalwood is not being used. Tomatoes, badnikai, there is no formula for this. This formula is different, that formula is different. This sandalwood is not even perishable. This is not being used as a plant, as a plant, as a plant. This is not being used as a plant, as a plant, as a plant. If you have 500 acres, what you will do is, this is an ETR machine, an electronic device. An electronic device, which we check. If you fix it here, then it has a bark, a sapod, a horn, and a 5% yield. Then, you can get the best 500 acres. You can get the best 500 acres. You can get the best marker, body, and that too. Then, you will get your commitment. If you get this one, you will get 10,000 acres. If you get another one, you will get 10,000 acres. If you get another 5 years, you will get 10,000 rupees. So, the farmer, the farmer, has no interest in getting the land in the same period. No bank will give him any amount of interest. That is what he has. So, when he has no interest, he has a commitment, a desire. He will build that much. He will get good rates. When the market is flooded, when the market is flooded, the market will be flooded. Did Godambi, Badami, and others do this? So, Srikanth and others, I have written this. Srikanth, our friend, Srikanth, is a poor farmer. Why is he a poor farmer? I have made this video. Srikanth, is a poor farmer. Why is he a poor farmer? Because we don't have a good harvest. We don't have a good harvest. We don't have a good harvest. Another thing is, Srikanth, is a poor farmer. Another thing is, why is he a poor farmer? Because he is a poor farmer. He is a poor farmer. Why? Like this. Another thing is, Srikanth, is a poor farmer. Because everyone is a poor farmer. He doesn't get a rate. Look, the country has come to this. Like this. Everyone has a good harvest. He doesn't get a rate. Until one, he doesn't get a rate. He doesn't get a rate. It's impossible. He would have been so poor if he had lived. He would have been so poor if he had lived. He would have been so poor if he had lived. But, if he had been a poor farmer, Srikanth wouldn't have got a rate. He wouldn't have gotten a rate. Mostly, he used to go to the market and buy lion, lioness, and other things. He wouldn't have gotten a rate. That's why he doesn't get a rate. He doesn't get a rate. If there are any benefits or issues, if there are any difficulties, one must have the ability to benefit from those difficulties. This is our land. Another thing is, when everyone gets a rate, the market will be down. That's why it's called a downing. It's a sign of fear. And also, you should know that birds... Even though we are making noise, birds can hear us. Birds can go. They are very shy. They are allergic to humans. They are afraid of humans. They are already going a little far inside. This is our downing forest. Our fathers, Devendra Poboluti, were born in the 80s. Our fathers were very well educated. We were influenced by them. We lived in agriculture after our education. That's why it's called a downing forest. Even today, there are 30% of the population of the country is downing. And now, all of this is our downing forest. This is a 70 acre block. This is a downing forest. We planted this first. When this was being grown, when it was healthy, we had a retail market of 1 crore for every 2,000 years. We had already had a lot of money from there. It was growing well. We already knew about it. What was the market like? We had a lot of money from there. Then, we stopped fruit harvesting. We didn't have any other crops. We didn't have any small fruits. We didn't have any other harvesting. We had to come here to pick up birds, to eat, to build a hut, to lay eggs, to grow vegetables. We were happy here until we got the freedom to come here. We were happy with the family. This is a kind of forest. We don't do anything here. No matter how far we come, we come here and grow the coconut. Come, let's go here. We don't have anything here. We come here, grow the coconut. We don't have any trees. This is the AC room for the birds. The birds have AC rooms. They should be free. They stay here. This is Srikandha forest. You can see it there. These are all naturally regenerated through bird droppings. These are the trees. They are all grown. We can say that Srikandha forest is one tree. If we count the country, it is one lakh rupees. This is Srikandha forest. This is Srikandha forest. This is Srikandha forest. We can say that Srikandha forest is one. Try to say it's one. This is how it looks. This is how it looks like. This is normal. We won't läuft here. This is a bird seed. This is a seed, a fruit, a fruit. These are all bird seeds. They don't do any work that is difficult. And then they don't grow much. What happens here is that whenever we build a forest the birds of prey are very important. When we build a forest, the birds of prey are very important. But when we build a forest, the birds of prey are not important. They are not useful to us. They are not useful to us. Now, people are trying to find a way to make a living. Why, sir? Now, they are not useful to us. What happens is that the birds of prey are not useful to us. When we build a forest, the birds of prey are not useful to us. Now, let's see. I have been doing this for a while now. I came to a TV channel and asked what is the problem with birds? Today, I am building a forest. It is a bad forest. I want to be a forest. I want to build a forest for birds. If I wanted to build a forest, I would have made a bad forest. What happens is that you can't see what you see. It is possible. You can get food and shelter for it. For the bird of prey, you should get food and shelter. If you are late, you will get a mobile. You will get a mobile. What happens is that for bird of prey, food and shelter are very important for forest farming. These birds are given food and shelter. Let's see what we can do. Let's say that the bird is 15 feet wide. For example, this bird is 15 feet wide. Here, we have food and shelter. Let's say that the bird is 10 feet wide. How much? 10 feet. One bird is enough for one day. Big birds are different. One bird is enough for one day. One bird is enough for one day. Let's say that one bird is enough for one day. How much for one bird? 10 grams. 100 grams for one day. 100 grams for one day. 300 grams. 300 grams for one day, 300 grams. 3000 grams. 1000 grams. 36 grams. 35 grams. The most of the bird is P2O5 phosphoric acid. It has Berlin, Auxin, Cytokinase, Sulphur, nothing inside When it is 15 feet radius, when 36 kg birds are in it, how much it will follow the earth? How much the microbes will form semi-liquid? If we mix it with the water, it will form semi-liquid. How much it will follow? How much the earth will follow? Where will the bird go? It will be in the front of the bird. Bird, bird, tree, all the birds are in it. When 36 kg birds are in it, the dead body will be in the air. The organic carbon. How much the organic carbon will be in the earth? How much the earth will follow? When the earth follows the earth, it will follow the bird. It should follow the bird. This is the concept. Look here. It will keep on moving like this. We don't know how much water will be in it. All these. Now we will put the cart here. This is the work of the master. We are all people who work for a living. A person doesn't work for his personality. He is not aware of the reason why he came here. He is not aware of the situation we are in. We don't know where it will go. We don't know if we will give him the materials. This is why he works. Why? Because we need the equipment. You are all trees. There are farmers here. We are all imported trees. This is very costly. That's why birds are put here. Bird droppings. I need 1 kg of bird droppings. Not just the chicken. We don't have to go to the farm. I need 1 kg of bird droppings. I give 1,000 rupees for 1 kg. I will give 1,000 rupees for 1 kg. If I give 1,000 rupees for 1 kg, I can feed the birds. Is that okay? If I give 1,000 rupees for 1 kg, I can feed the birds. I can feed the birds. This is very costly. I can feed 1 kg birds. You should not feed that many birds. All the nutrients, nitrogens, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, magnesium, molybdenum, sulfur, and then gibberlings, argins, cytokinans, aminos, all of them. You should not feed them. You should not feed them. Mix some jaggery, and spray. See the result. It is a wonderful result. I will give 1,000 rupees for that. If I get it, I will give 1,000 rupees. I will give 1,000 rupees for 36 kg. Is that okay, sir? The birds are very important. The birds are very important. 36 kg birds are fed. 36 kg birds are fed. We can feed them every year. We can feed them every year. We can feed them with shampoo, paste, alichilla, and plastic. There is nothing today. Even birds are fed with a forest. What happens here is, we walk in the middle of the forest, and watch the birds. Come, sir. Come, sir. You and you talk, and then talk. What will you do if you get late? If you get late, you will have a problem. If you don't talk, they will think you are a servant. They will think you are a servant. They will think we are nothing. We are very dangerous if we get late. They will think we are nothing. They will think we are nothing. They will think we are nothing. Half knowledge. We are not that bad. If we have presence of mind, we will be free of cost. We are not that bad. I am not saying this. My family is not that good. My children are free. My children are not that good. My children are not that good. My children are not that good. If we have presence of mind, we will be free. I have tried to repeat the same. I have tried to repeat the same. At least a little. What happens is, they have come, but we have not got the purpose. We are not able to do that. What happens is, I am saying birds are birds. How important is that? We have not talked about it. We are standing at the border. How many places do we fall? 300. What happens is, we are in a very bad environment. There are birds who need food and shelter. We need to provide them with food. When we are there, what happens is, if you look here, can you see? I will go inside. You can sit here. I will say, beauty of Sandalwood. I will say, beauty of Sandalwood. Beauty of Sandalwood. I know one or two, you will see. What is beauty of Sandalwood? These are Sandalwood. One, two, three, four, four, four, four, five. These are all Srikandha. They grow like a bunch. They grow like a bunch. These are all naturally regenerated through bird droppings. Like birds, they grow like that. What happens is, if you come forward, you will see thousands of birds. This is a very native piece of sand. It is very adaptable species. This is Kannada, Gandhada and Chandanada. Why? This is called Nala Nandu. This is called Nala Nandu. This is called Nala Nandu. You can make a savidha with this. This is called Nala Nandu. This is called Nala Nandu. One, two, three, four, five. These are different species. This is different, this is different. Like that. Sometimes, in the desert, they grow like a bunch. I am not able to grow them. I have worked hard, I have worked hard, but I have not done anything. These are all birds. I have not done anything. They will say, why did you do this? You are giving me water and food. You have given me water and food. I have not taken any medicine. I have been sick. I have been living a long time. I am the one who has not taken any medicine. It has regenerated. We have not done anything. This is what I am saying. There are different species. Sometimes, you come, sometimes you go. Sometimes, you go to the beach. That is why I do not know if it is you or someone else. We are all living in the same world. We are all born in the same world. What happens here is, we will grow them in thousands. When we grow them in thousands, what will we do? We call it an ETR machine. We will make more inventions after the next generation. We will make more inventions after the next generation. If we just fix it, we will scan it. We will get the right results. We have a guest here. Out of 1000 plants, we get 50 plants per year. Can we get 50 plants? Can we get 50 plants? How much is 50 plants? 50 lakhs. Can we get 50 plants? Out of 1000 plants, we get 50 plants per year. How much is 50 plants per year? How much is 50 plants per year? We get 50 plants per year. How much is 50 plants per year? 50 lakhs. We have been working for 16 years. We have been working for 16 years. 50 lakhs is... that's it. Does that mean, if we have 50 plants per year, how much per year? 50 lakhs per year. 50 lakhs per year. When we get 50 plants per year and 50 lakhs per year, that will be a farmer, you will become gold miner. When his farming land was first called as Bangardhani, why is he now only called as a farmer? What does that mean? He should not be the owner of Bangardhani. This is the concept. Even a farming land, by feeding the animals, by giving them shelter, by giving them shelter, we call it a social responsibility. By doing social jobs, we have achieved a gold mining land. We have achieved a gold mining land. But, we should love this animal, we should grow that heart. We should grow that heart. This is the concept. If there is any doubt, there is a question. Is there a minimum of half a feet difference between the two? That is a good question. If the two are the same, there is no difference. There is no gap. That is a good question. I was also in the same question in Nirksha. What I mean is, now we are going to take the two from the two, and we will take the two from there. Come here, finish the work you have come here for. Why did you come to the village, why did you come to the village? Yesterday, I asked a question to the sir. When I explained everything, he said, how much is the difference? And then, everyone came to search. They came to 10 feet, 12 feet, and then to 12 feet. They asked, how is this? Now, who brought this? I brought it. The birds came. They accepted the land, and they started to work from the ground. Now, I am 12 feet tall. I don't know if that land can be used to sit on one chair. or if it can be used to sit on one chair. I don't know. I am 12 feet tall. I don't know the power of that land. That land is not used to sit on one chair. I don't know. I don't know the power of that land. Is it used for work? I am called, Summa Niru. Summa Niru is a method. Summa Niru. Summa Niru. Or, Kaddiyadasa Ko Bada. What do you know? You know that. You are bored, you are bored, then you go to sleep. Then you go to sleep. You think this is a role for you? No, it is not. When we were doing rock salt and when we were sleeping, we were thinking that this is the wrong way. We should believe this much. That's why I don't know the power of that land. Or, what is my principle? It is Summa Niru. I will see how beautiful the plant is. It is a natural pruning plant. We call it natural pruning. We call it self-cutting. It is self-pruning. I have seen this. It is a little out, right? It moves from left up to ground. It is a natural thing. It moves from pruning. It is self-cutting. See that secondary metabolism, it is called. Sir, sir you did not ask the question how will this plant scissors be? Hello Madam, I will give you water just like this. Just water. You know it, right? Just look at it. What happens here is, we have a nice bed. Even this one is made of sauerkraut. It has 16,000 seeds. I will show you the sauerkraut. You can see it in the bed. I will forget it one day. You can see it in the bed. I will show you. You can see it in the bed. You can see it in the bed. Even this one has 16,000 seeds. Even this one has 16,000 seeds. It has come back. It came in two, four and six. It came in six and eight. When it came in eight, it was 10,000 seeds. It was 990 seeds. It was 990 seeds. It was 10,000 seeds. This is IAS. I have done an exam. I have done an exam. This is IAS. I took a written exam. I have done some other things. Like this. I have done some physical things. I have done some oral things. I have not done anything else. This is IAS. I have completed my profession and I am on duty now. You should not take the examinations of nature with you. You know? Nature selected. These are all naturally regenerated through bird's droppings. This is beauty of Sandalwood. I will leave it here, that's what I will answer. Why shouldn't I leave it here? Why shouldn't I use the waste? That is what I will answer. After that, if you want to remain clean, you can use any medicine you want you can use any medicine you want you can use any medicine you want understand? the second mistake here is the spiders come and go if you look carefully the seeds are very hard I have collected around 100 species of seeds I have collected around 100 species of seeds you can see this is the seed for the seed this is the seed for the seed these are the seeds what do these seeds do? they make a hole in the ground they make a hole in the ground these are not flies these are the seeds of the trips, mites, epithets, jachits these are the seeds of the seeds they make a hole in the ground these seeds are eaten by another seed what is the reason for this? for one seed another seed acts as a predator this is called biological control this is called biological control control of the animal without using any chemicals without any man power this is the concept here for this our trips should be very tight and then here is the problem when we come to life when we come to life someone is very aggressive then our family father, mother when we are like this we are a little bit in a simple manner when we practice this method all these problems the problems of the egg are completely removed this is very important for our life we should not give a reaction to everything we should not immerse everything we should not check everything we should not check everything we should not live we should be a little bit simple we should be a little bit truthful simple manner without being simple we are divorced both of us are active both of us are active that is wrong if you stand in the way no one will tell you both of us are active if you stand in the way no one will tell you we should be a little bit simple simple manner if this is wrong there is no chance of divorce divorce is not a big deal when we go to America they say divorce is not a big deal but when we come here they say it is very difficult simple manner is the way to get out of life that is why when you are in the way you should not give a chemical reaction you should not give a chemical reaction you should not know what we are fighting you should not know what we are fighting give water we don't need water that is nature selected this is the way if you are going to die I will make a chart I will show you the chart we will do a first time plantation this is the way this is the way when you build this is the way when you build you have to bend bend the tree when you go inside it is not easy inside it is not easy yes, it is easy Srikanda asked one question how much does this go when you build it is not easy you like Srikanda you like Srikanda Srikanda is not like Benigada not like Aladumara or Allimara Sandalwood is medium sized species Srikanda is this is a small size this is a medium size this is not MRA first you have to know because one question is asked Srikanda is not going to build this size this size is dangerous if we go inside we will die we will die this is the size this is the medium I will show you 75, 80 this is the size this is the middle size this is not needed this is not enough this is a small size this size is enough this is enough this size is enough if you want to build one place is 3 lakhs I will also go to that place this is small this is enough we will give it we will give it to the people we will give it to the people this is enough this is enough this is enough this is enough I told you linear relationship between sharp wood and art wood this is enough if you play there, it will be full of water if you get the worst it will be less secondary metabolism ERT machine is very low our society should not be like this they should be at least one fee we will not do it we will not do it today we have a company we have registered a company Gandha medicinal and aromatic company now soap, cosmetics and other things we will not do that company ERT machine will be 17 lakhs you can take it yourself we will give service minimum nominal rate we will test and give the total report it will be easy this is the right way how much it is right how much it is right how much it is right sir another question sir we have a machine we have a machine there are two reasons for the farmer to go to the free forest one is the free forest the other is the white forest where did you come from? from Vijayapura from Vijayapura where? Vijayapura proper Vijayapura local the owner another question we have been talking since three days free market for any whatever we have benefits and disadvantages for any now Srikandha free market free market this is Manjunath and another we will start how many people are there now? 17 there should be there should be there should be there should be there should be how many people are there? for that many food should be provided yes we should not give him time sir who will collect they will be there double one three three sir very important question what is wrong for our people Srikandha is the factory of Mysore sandal it is easy to talk about this to talk about this how easy it is because he doesn't know when to build we are going to market we are going to buy shoes shoes shoes shoes we are going to buy we are going to buy we are going to buy we are going to buy I am telling you that is the worst because when Srikandha went to buy he dried them he went shopping he didn't know what is the price what is this? why? he didn't know he worked for 16 years he was so poor he came to you how much did he spend he said so from this case we are going to give him a free hand sir this is 16 years now he doesn't have any alternative choice he is a prince we are going to take him there we are going to take him there is no choice this was going on we have to give him one thing we are going to give him monopsoni number of sellers buyer opponent that is monopsoni monopony is number of buyers seller opponent this is monopsoni this is not good for the farmer multiple choice is what is happening there work is going on unfortunately when there are sadhaka there will be problems we are going to give him free hand tomorrow it will be a problem for the farmer something like that for me at my age 16 years experience about 2 decades experience in this farm and because of my 16 years experience my legs are very weak both are weak there is no one who can help me there is no one who can help me they come to us they come to us they plant in sandalwood I stay with them I stay with them mostly I stay with them I stay with them I stay with them I stay with them what is happening they come to us they come to us they come to us why are you showing this question I will complete it why are you showing it I am telling you sadhaka is there what is happening here they they go to the slum why slum? to pay the debt we are beggars they they don't go to the office single window if they have one request the officer has to come home and give them permit letter they don't have to pay 20 rupees why they have to pay 16 years they are planting one seed 16000 seeds have been spread between the two birds he doesn't know 16000 seeds have been planted he is the reason why he has to trouble he has to come to office he has to pay the debt and get permit for this much hours days and hours he has decided to cut it to cut it ETR, etc. it is ok he has to get permit for this much hours that is also there brother what is the problem is that the number of colors is increasing now the number of colors is increasing this law is related to industry the factory is a place of industry how much industry you are sacrificing why you have to give it to them authorized authentic from the government to the government do it more if you do it more who will pay 10 rupees we will give it to them here also we don't know but we will get alternative choice who wants raw material he will give the rate if i don't have the money 10 companies will come here sir i will give this rate i will give this rate i will give this rate i will give the best rate who will pay the amount they will also and during the time of the debt he has to pay the payment he should not sleep before his office he should not sleep before his office brother let's discuss this again we didn't discuss this government did they gave the number when we put the bet they will know if they are also interested we asked them for minimum 2000 times you are sleeping somewhere we are not going to take photos we don't need that we should ask them our heart we should feel our pain we need minimum 2000 times this happened like this this is the question this is the problem mostly it is not a problem because when they are not paying they have a chain this is a problem they are going they have a chain we will tell you how to cut the chain because they are not paying they are not they are not paying they are trying they don't want that because they are in jail they are experiencing this is not good we should not do this next one one one one one one one one one one sir my name is GS Kamthar GS Kamthar what are you doing? we are doing planting we are converting to forest you are doing good this is what we are doing how many people when you ask many people many scientists here Ramesh IWST many scientists now they are asking first question in that farm I made farm this is all good good good many Tinasapura Sissas Thondaya Amrita Dagadi there is a big difference what they are they are clean self they are clean their question is why did you build that tree or why did you build that tree so that it can be taken from the forest here in nature there is a game game with the help of the vessels here here I want to change the forest I want to remove the forest what I want my goal my economic part that is what is happening here when the vessels are formed the birds stay in the AC room the birds stay in the AC room what do we do birds stay there the vessels are there from March February March, April, May June the grapes are red we just go to the book and read the book the birds are there",in the forest there are trees trees and the sea there the trees are good but when we look at srikandhu benigada jaligada when we look at this our part is the best benigada is so good in our part but it doesnt come in mallinane jaligada when it comes to us it doesnt come in mallinane when it comes to us it doesnt come in mallinane even srikandha from there it comes to us well in our head because why srikandha comes to us well because we dont want a big tree there is another question how big should srikandha be to come to the forest there is no linear relationship between the size of the plant volume of the plant biomass of the plant do you understand there is no linear relationship between size of the plant volume of the plant biomass of the plant that means we dont need to be so big you have given us water everything you have given us coconut you have given us all the coconut we dont know the difficulty of the plant we have to see that it is a plant that is not growing well now it is more vegetative luxurious growth there is no secondary metabolism the plant doesnt go in stress what we need is not bark not sharp wood brown color inside we need that we need not only bark but also a good moisture and high temperature we need to have a low temperature and a high temperature now the plant doesnt have a high temperature and a temperature of degrees what should we do we should put a plant in the ground there is no secondary metabolism there is a temperature of degrees what should we do we should put a plant in the ground there is no secondary metabolism there is a high temperature then the plant will grow well i will show you the plant will grow well now what should we do inside the sharp wood what should we do it will kill the plant we need secondary metabolism for that it is nothing but defensive mechanism against drought it is nothing but formation of art and accumulation of oil where the whistle is blowing it stops the plant it needs to live it doesnt need to grow it needs to live it needs to live it needs to live it needs to live it needs to live what should we do it stops the growth of the plant it stops the growth of the plant now the defensive mechanism is needed to live it is called secondary metabolism it is nothing but formation of art wood and accumulation of oil it is nothing but formation of art wood and accumulation of oil inside art wood formation is started we call it church but if we take oil we have to pay a huge price we have to pay that price we are afraid of people what wrong have i done they are lazy they are not good they are not good then we have a burden then we have a burden so we have to utilize the soil so we have to utilize the soil so we have to utilize the soil the forest effects are different we will see this blood circulation is not that bad blood circulation is not that bad blood circulation is like if you cross two trees you should not do anything to the third tree they will water the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the and then we will have a good harvest and then what is this todays government benefits and then in our country we get good harvest not only in mallinadi in mallinadi we get more vegetative growth biomass is more secondary metabolism is less there is a lot of waste the catch is less our plants are like this the growth is less the growth is more so we say there is no linear relationship between size of the plant and quantity of part of the plant when tourism turns green even with rotten native away theres no vax of nathal sabudha is the best is refusing to what is the relationship between the two definitely sir it is a good relationship it is not a bad thing it is a bad thing because what happens is that for one year there is no rain for one year there is no rain for one year there is no rain for one year there is no rain for one year there is no rain for one year there is no rain and above all nature has its own temperature and that is the relationship in this way when we go to the forest when there is no forest the plant does not get stressed now it is less for the young it was less for the young but the secondary metabolism was better that means the artid formation was better the oil accumulation was better this year when the rain was better the gestative growth was more in malinand if something happens it is difficult artid formation takes time when we go to malinand or when we go to mathadu we say that you need years do you have any problem with the late arrival no you have no problem with the late arrival what is your question you have to come and ask i will tell you to come at what is your question you have to come and ask if you ask me your question will be another question if you ask them they will ask and they will answer what happens here is what we tell malinand people is that you need years to get srikandha we cannot tell bisul naini we cannot tell bisul naini we are lucky to have you the reason is when we come here after years we have ingari felakas when we show them we show them ingari felakas mungari felakas after years the ingari mungari is completely we are lucky to have them we are lucky to have them we have felakas in years we will have ingari and mungari ingari and mungari in years we have felakas in years we will have ingari and mungari we will have them completely they will be good they will be good they will be good they will be good they will be good they will be good they will be good they will be good they will be good in years we will have ingari and mungari after we get them completely we will be happy we will buy clothes we will wash clothes we will have them completely half of them will be dead half will be dead we will do it till we are alive and then we will be able to see the children who died in the past we will be thankful to them we will be thankful to them that is the part what happens to us here is this srikandha is our host why is it our host it is not just a place to come and go it is a place of secondary metabolism we have thought of it as early induction of artwood we have thought of it as early induction of artwood now today we will listen to the experiences of the teachers and the farmers who were there we will listen to their experiences we should not be disappointed we should not be disappointed then we should be happy we should be happy to see the children and to see them come fast brother when will you be happy why do you keep that in mind will you be happy when you see them happy we should be able to create a better environment for them that is the building of aseer kaadan this is not just a rock this is a rock we have economic life it is not just about economic life along with economic life we have a healthy life we have a life of inspiration we have a life of spirituality you have built a wall right how much you build a wall how many birds build a nest take soil build a tree until they get their own security they are blessed there the three birds are together in the family the birds are like a rock the birds are blessed the three birds in the family are together if they are together they can fly like a bird they are called human birds they are called birds but if the three birds are together they can see your life you have built a wall right they can see your life they can see your world where you have been blessed your family you have built a wall they can see your world and pray to god god give health to this family god give happiness to this family god give peace to this family the three birds pray to god for their own safety god give health to this family god give peace to this family we put forward our efforts to the meditation we didnt put forward our efforts to the meditation what do we do the sriman thika is not one that is taken too far it is one that is taken away the bananaipati needs depth loving and evanakita needs well having literally he needs so much both as whatsoever is happening so it is a way of living a healthy ideal and spiritual life so they say kurshito naasthi durbiksham more than a million students more than a million students another student said in the same period belief drahachintanam they said that but when it comes to agriculture kurshito naasthi durbiksham to do good agriculture kalibilu nim papa nivanakatanam our dashinikuru gnanigalu so today we decide one one one one the best place to build a temple is our govindaraj siddheshwara swamiji they take their words in their own words because it is better to build a temple than temples because since we have built a temple there are up down caste dharma sun god all that is there when the storm comes the temple does not have a compound anymore there govindaraj and many other priests are taking clothes for competition the problem is the lowly that is it but he is a gentleman there is no point in asking when he is taken to govindarajs school these priests take him to the garbh gude if a person is taken there he will not be able to talk this is our temple but these trees they give air to everyone they give food they give shelter they grow the leaves the flowers and the water they give clean water in this way it is better to build a temple than temples in this way how many temples have you built the last one was if you say temples other temples are built temples you will say temples are built you will say temples are built you will say temples are built this is the truth in this way what happens is this is a treebased agriculture and it is a good harvest because there is no chance of harvest if you come to the forest the law will be broken and from the last two days you will notice that the law is different you will learn different things in this way from the beginning what we should do is where we should go is we should ask what should we do to prevent the farmer from being killed the shanayar will kill us there because they have passed the exams the secretary director and the shanayar have killed them there they know we are ready to take any other experience from our side they have a strong will to work they have built the dams for the law so that they dont get killed they have built that dam what we are lucky to know is all these land is grown in the forest the land is built for the forest it is built for the forest it is a treasure it is a treasure it is a treasure i have also done this i have done this i have done this i have done this someone someone from the other side has done this if we get good land then our countryman has done this our average farmer does a good job this way the people from our side have done this everything is built here what happens here he has said to get good land or someone has done this the small farmer has got a good return what have we forgotten how much money will we get i have forgotten so we call this a replicate one acre is acres not acres acres is acres in this bishulnand if there were no trees it would have been a land of the malaynadi whenever the malaynadi was built the rain would have been heavy when the rain was heavy when the trees were good the soil would not go down the rice fields would have been like this the water would have been given to the farmers the rice fields would have been filled with water when we were small we used to drink water we used to drink water to make us happy our children used to live like that now when the malaynadi people see our land they should respect us how beautiful is your land now when we go there the people of kopal district raichur district ballar district there are bishul barthana dhula gulevai people if we tell them about our district they will get another picture that atmosphere will change that power is there at the same time if there were acres it would have been acres then the problem arises the area has increased the market has gone down the sandalwood is not being used tomatoes badnikai there is no formula for this this formula is different that formula is different this sandalwood is not even perishable this is not being used as a plant as a plant as a plant this is not being used as a plant as a plant as a plant if you have acres what you will do is this is an etr machine an electronic device an electronic device which we check if you fix it here then it has a bark a sapod a horn and a yield then you can get the best acres you can get the best acres you can get the best marker body and that too then you will get your commitment if you get this one you will get acres if you get another one you will get acres if you get another years you will get rupees so the farmer the farmer has no interest in getting the land in the same period no bank will give him any amount of interest that is what he has so when he has no interest he has a commitment a desire he will build that much he will get good rates when the market is flooded when the market is flooded the market will be flooded did godambi badami and others do this so srikanth and others i have written this srikanth our friend srikanth is a poor farmer why is he a poor farmer i have made this video srikanth is a poor farmer why is he a poor farmer because we dont have a good harvest we dont have a good harvest we dont have a good harvest another thing is srikanth is a poor farmer another thing is why is he a poor farmer because he is a poor farmer he is a poor farmer why like this another thing is srikanth is a poor farmer because everyone is a poor farmer he doesnt get a rate look the country has come to this like this everyone has a good harvest he doesnt get a rate until one he doesnt get a rate he doesnt get a rate its impossible he would have been so poor if he had lived he would have been so poor if he had lived he would have been so poor if he had lived but if he had been a poor farmer srikanth wouldnt have got a rate he wouldnt have gotten a rate mostly he used to go to the market and buy lion lioness and other things he wouldnt have gotten a rate thats why he doesnt get a rate he doesnt get a rate if there are any benefits or issues if there are any difficulties one must have the ability to benefit from those difficulties this is our land another thing is when everyone gets a rate the market will be down thats why its called a downing its a sign of fear and also you should know that birds even though we are making noise birds can hear us birds can go they are very shy they are allergic to humans they are afraid of humans they are already going a little far inside this is our downing forest our fathers devendra poboluti were born in the s our fathers were very well educated we were influenced by them we lived in agriculture after our education thats why its called a downing forest even today there are of the population of the country is downing and now all of this is our downing forest this is a acre block this is a downing forest we planted this first when this was being grown when it was healthy we had a retail market of crore for every years we had already had a lot of money from there it was growing well we already knew about it what was the market like we had a lot of money from there then we stopped fruit harvesting we didnt have any other crops we didnt have any small fruits we didnt have any other harvesting we had to come here to pick up birds to eat to build a hut to lay eggs to grow vegetables we were happy here until we got the freedom to come here we were happy with the family this is a kind of forest we dont do anything here no matter how far we come we come here and grow the coconut come lets go here we dont have anything here we come here grow the coconut we dont have any trees this is the ac room for the birds the birds have ac rooms they should be free they stay here this is srikandha forest you can see it there these are all naturally regenerated through bird droppings these are the trees they are all grown we can say that srikandha forest is one tree if we count the country it is one lakh rupees this is srikandha forest this is srikandha forest this is srikandha forest we can say that srikandha forest is one try to say its one this is how it looks this is how it looks like this is normal we wont luft here this is a bird seed this is a seed a fruit a fruit these are all bird seeds they dont do any work that is difficult and then they dont grow much what happens here is that whenever we build a forest the birds of prey are very important when we build a forest the birds of prey are very important but when we build a forest the birds of prey are not important they are not useful to us they are not useful to us now people are trying to find a way to make a living why sir now they are not useful to us what happens is that the birds of prey are not useful to us when we build a forest the birds of prey are not useful to us now lets see i have been doing this for a while now i came to a tv channel and asked what is the problem with birds today i am building a forest it is a bad forest i want to be a forest i want to build a forest for birds if i wanted to build a forest i would have made a bad forest what happens is that you cant see what you see it is possible you can get food and shelter for it for the bird of prey you should get food and shelter if you are late you will get a mobile you will get a mobile what happens is that for bird of prey food and shelter are very important for forest farming these birds are given food and shelter lets see what we can do lets say that the bird is feet wide for example this bird is feet wide here we have food and shelter lets say that the bird is feet wide how much feet one bird is enough for one day big birds are different one bird is enough for one day one bird is enough for one day lets say that one bird is enough for one day how much for one bird grams grams for one day grams for one day grams grams for one day grams grams grams grams grams the most of the bird is po phosphoric acid it has berlin auxin cytokinase sulphur nothing inside when it is feet radius when kg birds are in it how much it will follow the earth how much the microbes will form semiliquid if we mix it with the water it will form semiliquid how much it will follow how much the earth will follow where will the bird go it will be in the front of the bird bird bird tree all the birds are in it when kg birds are in it the dead body will be in the air the organic carbon how much the organic carbon will be in the earth how much the earth will follow when the earth follows the earth it will follow the bird it should follow the bird this is the concept look here it will keep on moving like this we dont know how much water will be in it all these now we will put the cart here this is the work of the master we are all people who work for a living a person doesnt work for his personality he is not aware of the reason why he came here he is not aware of the situation we are in we dont know where it will go we dont know if we will give him the materials this is why he works why because we need the equipment you are all trees there are farmers here we are all imported trees this is very costly thats why birds are put here bird droppings i need kg of bird droppings not just the chicken we dont have to go to the farm i need kg of bird droppings i give rupees for kg i will give rupees for kg if i give rupees for kg i can feed the birds is that okay if i give rupees for kg i can feed the birds i can feed the birds this is very costly i can feed kg birds you should not feed that many birds all the nutrients nitrogens phosphorus potassium magnesium magnesium molybdenum sulfur and then gibberlings argins cytokinans aminos all of them you should not feed them you should not feed them mix some jaggery and spray see the result it is a wonderful result i will give rupees for that if i get it i will give rupees i will give rupees for kg is that okay sir the birds are very important the birds are very important kg birds are fed kg birds are fed we can feed them every year we can feed them every year we can feed them with shampoo paste alichilla and plastic there is nothing today even birds are fed with a forest what happens here is we walk in the middle of the forest and watch the birds come sir come sir you and you talk and then talk what will you do if you get late if you get late you will have a problem if you dont talk they will think you are a servant they will think you are a servant they will think we are nothing we are very dangerous if we get late they will think we are nothing they will think we are nothing they will think we are nothing half knowledge we are not that bad if we have presence of mind we will be free of cost we are not that bad i am not saying this my family is not that good my children are free my children are not that good my children are not that good my children are not that good if we have presence of mind we will be free i have tried to repeat the same i have tried to repeat the same at least a little what happens is they have come but we have not got the purpose we are not able to do that what happens is i am saying birds are birds how important is that we have not talked about it we are standing at the border how many places do we fall what happens is we are in a very bad environment there are birds who need food and shelter we need to provide them with food when we are there what happens is if you look here can you see i will go inside you can sit here i will say beauty of sandalwood i will say beauty of sandalwood beauty of sandalwood i know one or two you will see what is beauty of sandalwood these are sandalwood one two three four four four four five these are all srikandha they grow like a bunch they grow like a bunch these are all naturally regenerated through bird droppings like birds they grow like that what happens is if you come forward you will see thousands of birds this is a very native piece of sand it is very adaptable species this is kannada gandhada and chandanada why this is called nala nandu this is called nala nandu this is called nala nandu you can make a savidha with this this is called nala nandu this is called nala nandu one two three four five these are different species this is different this is different like that sometimes in the desert they grow like a bunch i am not able to grow them i have worked hard i have worked hard but i have not done anything these are all birds i have not done anything they will say why did you do this you are giving me water and food you have given me water and food i have not taken any medicine i have been sick i have been living a long time i am the one who has not taken any medicine it has regenerated we have not done anything this is what i am saying there are different species sometimes you come sometimes you go sometimes you go to the beach that is why i do not know if it is you or someone else we are all living in the same world we are all born in the same world what happens here is we will grow them in thousands when we grow them in thousands what will we do we call it an etr machine we will make more inventions after the next generation we will make more inventions after the next generation if we just fix it we will scan it we will get the right results we have a guest here out of plants we get plants per year can we get plants can we get plants how much is plants lakhs can we get plants out of plants we get plants per year how much is plants per year how much is plants per year we get plants per year how much is plants per year lakhs we have been working for years we have been working for years lakhs is thats it does that mean if we have plants per year how much per year lakhs per year lakhs per year when we get plants per year and lakhs per year that will be a farmer you will become gold miner when his farming land was first called as bangardhani why is he now only called as a farmer what does that mean he should not be the owner of bangardhani this is the concept even a farming land by feeding the animals by giving them shelter by giving them shelter we call it a social responsibility by doing social jobs we have achieved a gold mining land we have achieved a gold mining land but we should love this animal we should grow that heart we should grow that heart this is the concept if there is any doubt there is a question is there a minimum of half a feet difference between the two that is a good question if the two are the same there is no difference there is no gap that is a good question i was also in the same question in nirksha what i mean is now we are going to take the two from the two and we will take the two from there come here finish the work you have come here for why did you come to the village why did you come to the village yesterday i asked a question to the sir when i explained everything he said how much is the difference and then everyone came to search they came to feet feet and then to feet they asked how is this now who brought this i brought it the birds came they accepted the land and they started to work from the ground now i am feet tall i dont know if that land can be used to sit on one chair or if it can be used to sit on one chair i dont know i am feet tall i dont know the power of that land that land is not used to sit on one chair i dont know i dont know the power of that land is it used for work i am called summa niru summa niru is a method summa niru summa niru or kaddiyadasa ko bada what do you know you know that you are bored you are bored then you go to sleep then you go to sleep you think this is a role for you no it is not when we were doing rock salt and when we were sleeping we were thinking that this is the wrong way we should believe this much thats why i dont know the power of that land or what is my principle it is summa niru i will see how beautiful the plant is it is a natural pruning plant we call it natural pruning we call it selfcutting it is selfpruning i have seen this it is a little out right it moves from left up to ground it is a natural thing it moves from pruning it is selfcutting see that secondary metabolism it is called sir sir you did not ask the question how will this plant scissors be hello madam i will give you water just like this just water you know it right just look at it what happens here is we have a nice bed even this one is made of sauerkraut it has seeds i will show you the sauerkraut you can see it in the bed i will forget it one day you can see it in the bed i will show you you can see it in the bed you can see it in the bed even this one has seeds even this one has seeds it has come back it came in two four and six it came in six and eight when it came in eight it was seeds it was seeds it was seeds it was seeds this is ias i have done an exam i have done an exam this is ias i took a written exam i have done some other things like this i have done some physical things i have done some oral things i have not done anything else this is ias i have completed my profession and i am on duty now you should not take the examinations of nature with you you know nature selected these are all naturally regenerated through birds droppings this is beauty of sandalwood i will leave it here thats what i will answer why shouldnt i leave it here why shouldnt i use the waste that is what i will answer after that if you want to remain clean you can use any medicine you want you can use any medicine you want you can use any medicine you want understand the second mistake here is the spiders come and go if you look carefully the seeds are very hard i have collected around species of seeds i have collected around species of seeds you can see this is the seed for the seed this is the seed for the seed these are the seeds what do these seeds do they make a hole in the ground they make a hole in the ground these are not flies these are the seeds of the trips mites epithets jachits these are the seeds of the seeds they make a hole in the ground these seeds are eaten by another seed what is the reason for this for one seed another seed acts as a predator this is called biological control this is called biological control control of the animal without using any chemicals without any man power this is the concept here for this our trips should be very tight and then here is the problem when we come to life when we come to life someone is very aggressive then our family father mother when we are like this we are a little bit in a simple manner when we practice this method all these problems the problems of the egg are completely removed this is very important for our life we should not give a reaction to everything we should not immerse everything we should not check everything we should not check everything we should not live we should be a little bit simple we should be a little bit truthful simple manner without being simple we are divorced both of us are active both of us are active that is wrong if you stand in the way no one will tell you both of us are active if you stand in the way no one will tell you we should be a little bit simple simple manner if this is wrong there is no chance of divorce divorce is not a big deal when we go to america they say divorce is not a big deal but when we come here they say it is very difficult simple manner is the way to get out of life that is why when you are in the way you should not give a chemical reaction you should not give a chemical reaction you should not know what we are fighting you should not know what we are fighting give water we dont need water that is nature selected this is the way if you are going to die i will make a chart i will show you the chart we will do a first time plantation this is the way this is the way when you build this is the way when you build you have to bend bend the tree when you go inside it is not easy inside it is not easy yes it is easy srikanda asked one question how much does this go when you build it is not easy you like srikanda you like srikanda srikanda is not like benigada not like aladumara or allimara sandalwood is medium sized species srikanda is this is a small size this is a medium size this is not mra first you have to know because one question is asked srikanda is not going to build this size this size is dangerous if we go inside we will die we will die this is the size this is the medium i will show you this is the size this is the middle size this is not needed this is not enough this is a small size this size is enough this is enough this size is enough if you want to build one place is lakhs i will also go to that place this is small this is enough we will give it we will give it to the people we will give it to the people this is enough this is enough this is enough this is enough i told you linear relationship between sharp wood and art wood this is enough if you play there it will be full of water if you get the worst it will be less secondary metabolism ert machine is very low our society should not be like this they should be at least one fee we will not do it we will not do it today we have a company we have registered a company gandha medicinal and aromatic company now soap cosmetics and other things we will not do that company ert machine will be lakhs you can take it yourself we will give service minimum nominal rate we will test and give the total report it will be easy this is the right way how much it is right how much it is right how much it is right sir another question sir we have a machine we have a machine there are two reasons for the farmer to go to the free forest one is the free forest the other is the white forest where did you come from from vijayapura from vijayapura where vijayapura proper vijayapura local the owner another question we have been talking since three days free market for any whatever we have benefits and disadvantages for any now srikandha free market free market this is manjunath and another we will start how many people are there now there should be there should be there should be there should be there should be how many people are there for that many food should be provided yes we should not give him time sir who will collect they will be there double one three three sir very important question what is wrong for our people srikandha is the factory of mysore sandal it is easy to talk about this to talk about this how easy it is because he doesnt know when to build we are going to market we are going to buy shoes shoes shoes shoes we are going to buy we are going to buy we are going to buy we are going to buy i am telling you that is the worst because when srikandha went to buy he dried them he went shopping he didnt know what is the price what is this why he didnt know he worked for years he was so poor he came to you how much did he spend he said so from this case we are going to give him a free hand sir this is years now he doesnt have any alternative choice he is a prince we are going to take him there we are going to take him there is no choice this was going on we have to give him one thing we are going to give him monopsoni number of sellers buyer opponent that is monopsoni monopony is number of buyers seller opponent this is monopsoni this is not good for the farmer multiple choice is what is happening there work is going on unfortunately when there are sadhaka there will be problems we are going to give him free hand tomorrow it will be a problem for the farmer something like that for me at my age years experience about decades experience in this farm and because of my years experience my legs are very weak both are weak there is no one who can help me there is no one who can help me they come to us they come to us they plant in sandalwood i stay with them i stay with them mostly i stay with them i stay with them i stay with them i stay with them what is happening they come to us they come to us they come to us why are you showing this question i will complete it why are you showing it i am telling you sadhaka is there what is happening here they they go to the slum why slum to pay the debt we are beggars they they dont go to the office single window if they have one request the officer has to come home and give them permit letter they dont have to pay rupees why they have to pay years they are planting one seed seeds have been spread between the two birds he doesnt know seeds have been planted he is the reason why he has to trouble he has to come to office he has to pay the debt and get permit for this much hours days and hours he has decided to cut it to cut it etr etc it is ok he has to get permit for this much hours that is also there brother what is the problem is that the number of colors is increasing now the number of colors is increasing this law is related to industry the factory is a place of industry how much industry you are sacrificing why you have to give it to them authorized authentic from the government to the government do it more if you do it more who will pay rupees we will give it to them here also we dont know but we will get alternative choice who wants raw material he will give the rate if i dont have the money companies will come here sir i will give this rate i will give this rate i will give this rate i will give the best rate who will pay the amount they will also and during the time of the debt he has to pay the payment he should not sleep before his office he should not sleep before his office brother lets discuss this again we didnt discuss this government did they gave the number when we put the bet they will know if they are also interested we asked them for minimum times you are sleeping somewhere we are not going to take photos we dont need that we should ask them our heart we should feel our pain we need minimum times this happened like this this is the question this is the problem mostly it is not a problem because when they are not paying they have a chain this is a problem they are going they have a chain we will tell you how to cut the chain because they are not paying they are not they are not paying they are trying they dont want that because they are in jail they are experiencing this is not good we should not do this next one one one one one one one one one one sir my name is gs kamthar gs kamthar what are you doing we are doing planting we are converting to forest you are doing good this is what we are doing how many people when you ask many people many scientists here ramesh iwst many scientists now they are asking first question in that farm i made farm this is all good good good many tinasapura sissas thondaya amrita dagadi there is a big difference what they are they are clean self they are clean their question is why did you build that tree or why did you build that tree so that it can be taken from the forest here in nature there is a game game with the help of the vessels here here i want to change the forest i want to remove the forest what i want my goal my economic part that is what is happening here when the vessels are formed the birds stay in the ac room the birds stay in the ac room what do we do birds stay there the vessels are there from march february march april may june the grapes are red we just go to the book and read the book the birds are

SandalWoodNewsStories_295,"Friends, you can subscribe to our channel and click the bell button to get notified about our new videos. Welcome to the Vishmaya Kannada channel. Friends, India may have been a golden age in the ancient times, but you may not know it. Because the natural resources of India were the natural resources of the Heralas. If you destroy more of the Heralas than the colonists, you may become a magician in some time. But India has a very rich and prosperous land. The blood moon has become one among them. Yes friends, you may have seen the picture of Pushpa the rice that you saw yesterday. But the story revolves around the same blood moon. In science, the tree called Teracarpus centillinus is found only in South India. The most prosperous and high quality blood moon trees are found only in the end of Andhra Pradesh. The blood moon tree is more than the tree of Srivastava in South India. As I said earlier, in the world of the forest, this tree is the only one that is found in our country. If you ask for the price of this blood moon, you will definitely be in trouble. Yes, this blood moon is made of stone and is 1 kg in size, and it is worth 20 to 30 thousand rupees. A 10-ton blood moon tree can hold up to 20 to 30 kg of stone. If you smuggle it and change it, you will get up to 6 lakhs worth of stone. So, if you don't have a ton of blood moon, you will have to pay 2 crores. For this reason, the special forces are also responsible for the safety of the tree. Friends, why is this blood moon so rare and rare? In ancient times, our ancestors used to make blood moon in Ayurveda. Later, it can be used to cure skin diseases. As time goes by, the best blood moon in India is known to the world of the forest. It can be used in various medicinal medicines and beauty products. The value of the most expensive products is much higher. For example, take petrol. In any country, the oil prices are very low in that country. But India is oil-free, so we have a lot of petrol and diesel. The same situation is also a blood moon. Blood moon is found only in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. From here, many trees are cut down by the foreign countries. But China does not burn the blood moon. Because China cuts down the tree in the palm of its hand and in other areas. So much so that China has come to cure thousands of diseases from diseases. So, blood moon can be cut down in thousands of diseases. This is why the number of blood moon trees in China has increased. Only in China, blood moon is used in Japan and Mongolia to cure diseases. So, if China releases these medicinal properties, China will like this blood moon. About 700 years ago, during the 14th century, the Ming dynasty ruled China. According to the report published in China Daily, the blood moon was made by the Ming dynasty's royal family. It was said that the royal family had collected blood moon from there. They collected blood moon furniture and other precious things from there. We can see the characteristics of the Chinese medicine. Even though the blood moon was saved by the Ming dynasty, the law was not implemented to protect the rights of the people, the government and the police. The story of the blood moon is true. When the blood moon was cured in China, the death of trees began in the last forest. The workers went to the forest, cut down the trees and gave the smugglers food. Sometimes the smugglers would cut down the trees, cut down the trees and carry their pockets. These workers would have done the same in the opposite way. The police did not notice. It is not wrong that the former king of China was the son of this worker. The blood moon tree is about 8 to 11 meters tall. Another feature of this tree is that it is time to grow. If the normal tree is 10 years old, a blood moon tree should be 30 years old. But if it is grown by the farming, a tree will grow in the last 15 years. As mentioned earlier, the blood moon is very expensive in the international market. Because of this, the government spends millions of rupees every year on these trees for safety. The area of this forest is very important. Because the smugglers do not smuggle the blood moon when it is young. The smugglers supply 20,000 crores of blood moon every year. If the smugglers get these trees for the construction, they will be punished for the smuggling of the blood moon for 15 years. It would be a challenge for the government to protect the blood moon. Then you may ask, is this a blood moon tree that is very expensive in the world? There is no answer to this. There is a tree that is more expensive than the blood moon, African Blackwood. Yes, you may be surprised to hear the price of this tree. The price of this tree is 8,000 pounds, or 7 lakh rupees per kg in the international market. African Blackwood is a very rare tree on Earth. This tree is about 20 to 40 feet tall. This African Blackwood is found in 26 countries in Central and South Africa. The most expensive tree in the land of the African Blackwood is 60 years old. But the most expensive tree in Kenya and Tanzania, which is the most expensive tree in the world, is the most expensive tree in the world. Therefore, African Blackwood is the most expensive tree in the world. This is the result of this tree. African Blackwood is used to make African Blackwood music, to play the guitar and to play the drums. In addition, African Blackwood is used to make the most expensive and useful instruments. African Blackwood is used to make the most expensive and useful instruments. African Blackwood is used to make the most expensive and useful instruments.

This is the way from Bagalkot to Rayachur. There is a town called Kavitha. It is 2 km away from there. Welcome to Kavitha Mishra Farm. Welcome. As I said earlier, Kavitha Mishra is here. Greetings. How are you? I am fine. We are proud of you. I am happy to have accepted your tour. Thank you. There was a time when there was no news on social media. Now there is news. There are people who have learned about your past. Who are you to tell the whole story? I am Kavitha Muma Shankara Mishra. I am from Tavuramani, Dharwad. I am from Rayachur district of Kavitha. I got married here. I got my education and got married in Dharwad. I am doing agriculture and animal husbandry here. I got married in a small village. I had no heart to get married in this village. I had no opportunity to work outside. My husband told me that he would do something for the family. First of all, I didn't have a bicycle to go outside. This is the place? Yes. I had to sleep outside. I had a lump in my stomach. I couldn't feel anything. I couldn't feel any kind of pain. I had a lump in my stomach. A lump in your stomach? Yes. I couldn't feel anything. I couldn't feel anything. We didn't have a bicycle to go outside. There was a small road on the side of the road. It was very narrow. We had to walk on the side of the road. That's how it was. We had tried for 13-14 years to get to this level. Oh, really? Yes, we couldn't feel anything. We didn't have a light to go outside, when we started. No electricity? No. We started the same way. People were afraid that we might die here. There was such a situation. We didn't have anything. I had to get a bottle of water from the village. There was no water. It was completely empty. Empty? There was nothing. There was no parallel land. There was only stones and stones. We had to level it completely. We got to this level. We did it from the year of 2017 to 2018. We did it from 5 to 6 thousand meters. Within 8 acres. Within 1 inch of water. We didn't have water to drink. We had water in the bottom of the bottle. We did it within 1 inch of water. Within 8 acres? Yes, within 8 acres. Within 1 inch of water? Yes. You are an Infosys employee? Yes, it is true. What is your qualification? I completed my Diploma in Computer Science. I completed my MA in Sociology from Karnataka University. I completed my MA in Sociology from Karnataka University. I had a programming skill. I was selected as a programmer. But I didn't have the opportunity to work outside my husband's house. I didn't get a job. When I thought about what I should do, I was in between 4 walls. I wanted to live in my own world. I wanted to achieve something. When I asked my husband, He said, I will be a lawyer. I will do anything I can. I knew that the temperature here is 45 degrees. I didn't have the courage to go outside. I didn't have the courage to go outside. It was very difficult to accept such a challenge in this temperature. It was very difficult to accept such a challenge in this temperature. I accepted it and started. I faced many problems. I had a different desire. I had a different desire. I had a different desire. I saw that day. I did everything and showed it. Did you feel happy? No, sir. I did not have any. None. Nowhere was a home, or thought of any other way. Hence, it was not very hot here. They were making some temperature. The land was not so fertile. There was no source of water. At that time, I wanted to make my use of it, I made Dalimba first. Its own land. agriculture, and then we do this, not the right cultivation method. We have to try something different. That's what I planned, sir. Horticulture, agroforestry and animal husbandry. What did you do? Agriculture, for the gardeners, both agriculture and animal husbandry. Because we didn't do it alone, sir. Because what I did for monocropping was different. Single-billet? Yes. Now I have done integrated farming, sir. In the same way. What happens in that, sir? In the same way, we are doing different things. We are combining all the cultures, sir. That's why we are doing this, what we do in the same way. In this, there is agriculture, sir. There is farming, there is agroforestry, there is animal husbandry. Why I am saying this is because, agriculture is short-term. For example, the days. 3-4 months, life is 5-6 months, sir. It can be a pair, a pair of hair, a pair of horns, a pair of shoulders, a pair of legs, a pair of legs, a pair of hands. That's agriculture. This is agriculture, short-term. And what I have done in that is, I have done horticulture, that is mid-term. That means, from 1 to 10, 15 years, it is growing and growing. For example, if we do it in the name, it can be reduced from 1 acre to 5 to 6 tons in a year. We do it in the name, sir. It can be L49, Taiwan pink, Taiwan white. It will come soon. If we do it in the name, it will come in 3 years, sir. It can be Kesar, Dashari, Mallika, Banganpalli. I have done 4 varieties of mangoes, sir. If we do it in the name, it will not come in 1 year. It will fluctuate. It can be in a climatical condition or it can be in practices. We have done the name, mango, apple, betel nut, water, rice, curry, lime, and mace. That is the method of growing based on the season. Every season should be different. I have grown the tree, I am telling everyone that I have grown the tree in Karnataka. But since the beginning, we have not seen the tree for 15 years. Because we are all in the mid-term. We have a life of struggle. It is not a poem. It is a story of all Karnataka and Indian writers. Why I am telling this is because Srikandha is a very important tree. It is grown in the Ashray of Beria. So, if we want to plant a tree, we should plant Srikandha. Srikandha is a very important tree. It is a parasite. It requires the host. So, if we want to host it, no matter how much we have to host it, Srikandha should be a good food for us. We should support Srikandha and we should be a product of it. The farmer should be successful. How does a farmer's life go if he has been doing Srikandha for 15 years? For example, I have brought a boy from 18 to 25 years old. I have brought him to the farm to do the farming. He asks me one question. He says he gets salary in a month and retirement pension in a month. This system is set for that. Agriculture, horticulture, agroforestry, animal husbandry. Four combinations. We have planned all the combinations. Only then we will not have a problem of planting Srikandha in agriculture. I have seen that. I have practically taken success from that. I have seen Srikandha from 8 to 9 years old. This one. I will show you what I have done for the last 9 years. Srikandha has never grown. Because Srikandha has so many possibilities and responsibilities. It has become an extra problem for people. It is a mix. Whatever you take, What is the rate of Srikandha? What is the future? What is the use? What is the result? Then, the question of being able to get a farmer ready. There are many answers. Many questions that are confusing. We have to find out more answers. What I tell the farmer is that we have done all the things. We have done the work of planting, We have done the work of planting, We have done the work of planting, We have done everything. We have seen 1 crore per acre. We have not seen it. None of us have seen it. That is the truth. Then, if we talk about the farm, There are no pictures of the farm that we see. This is a terrible truth. What a terrible truth. You are not famous on YouTube or Facebook. YouTube and Facebook show colourful pictures. The farmer's life is not that colourful. It is very scary. How scary is it? Today, we talk about tractors. One tractor costs 800 to 900 rupees. One cow. I will get one cow. One cow costs 1700 rupees. One cow costs 500 rupees. One cow costs 300 rupees. We don't have the money to pay the rent. Because we have to pay the rent. We have to pay the rent. After doing all these things, What do we get in the end? What do we get in the end? What do we get in the end? Because the farmers will pay the rent. Because the farmers will pay the rent. Because that is our new year. We will pay the rent. We have spent so much money. We will get what we need. What do we get in the end? We get a flop. We get a record of the year. Because the cost of cultivation is getting lower. Because the cost of cultivation is getting lower. The income is getting lower. The income is getting lower because of agriculture. That is getting less. Because they both are not proportional to each other. We should think about that. We should think about that. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, The Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, In 2022, we should double the income. If the income is zero, If the income is zero, it will be zero. It will be double zero. If we multiply zero into zero, If we multiply zero into zero, It is zero only. It can't be infinite. If we want to go to infinity, This is the right time to think about it. This is the right time. That is why I say, The land is in our hands. Because every year, people are getting it. The land is getting it, isn't it? That is enough. That is where it is. If we want to go to the land, If we want to start that, If we want to start that, The creativity should come from the youngsters. Because our knife is over. Tomorrow, your hand is in our hands. That is why today, I will tell you what Grow Forestry is. It has become the need of the day. It has become the need of the day. Because, what everyone says, We are calculating this for MSP. Minimum supportive price. Minimum supportive price. Minimum supporting price. We are considering that. What do you consider in that? You, the government, We people, the people. Our work, our expenses, Our food, medicine, cow dung, How much it costs, That is what everyone considers. For MSP. And our land is destroyed. You are saying that because there is no land. You tell me. Even if there is land, You will cultivate it. If there is no land, You will be living in cities. You will not live in a 600 sq ft, With a single bedroom. And where will our land be destroyed? Where will our rental charges be? Where will our rental charges be? There is no way to do that. You tell me. No one is counting that. I selected Agroforestry to count that. I told you, This is Srikanth's long term crop. I told you. We have been planting Srikanth since 2012. How much land will be destroyed? Till then, it is a dead investment. Dead investment, sir. To destroy that land, To make it a better place, I was supporting Agroforestry. Why I am supporting Agroforestry? Because we are planting Srikanth. You know that it will not be done soon. We have to sleep for 15 years. If we have to sleep for 15 years, The farmer should be strong and have a strong will. For that, I have created a farm. We have planted Sita, Maa, Perla, In 8 to 10 acres, We have planted 2,000 Srikanth, 1,000 Maa, 600 Perla, 600 Sita, 100 Bettenellika, 300 Neerlan, 100 Hunsian, 100 Limba, 100 Kariba, 100 Nugyekaya, 100 Teng, 800 Sagwani. Single square feet of your land should not be wasted. It has the value. Every inch has value? Yes. I have done that. You may see it practically. Single square feet of your land should not be wasted. I am working on that, sir. And I am working on the project to try to reduce the cost of cultivation. You are reducing your agriculture. If you spend 10 lakhs, and if you spend 15 lakhs, you will not be a successful farmer, sir. 10 lakhs will be spent on food. What about the man? Why should you spend that much? That much is enough. You should reduce the cost of cultivation. If you spend 2 lakhs and get 5 lakhs, then you will be profitable. Then you will be profitable. Then you will be profitable. We should change our vision, our thinking, sir. I will tell you, if you want to sell your land, if you want to sell it, then you should spend 50 rupees. If you want to sell it, I will give you another chance. Because you have come here with 50 rupees. So, what I am saying is, earning is not important. Saving is important. So, you should not spend your land so much. You should reduce the cost and go with nature. You should not go against nature. You should not go against nature. But you should go with nature and do something for the farmer, as I do. I am doing this with the same effort. Water is my weakness. I knew it from the beginning. Because this is a farmer's land. I tried very hard, but I could not get water. After I knew that water is my weakness, I told you, Seetha Pala, water, rice, flour, you should not drink water. I knew that my weakness. You should not drink water. Your major crop is Srikandha. When you drink water, you will not have any oil. The more water you drink, the more oil content you will have. Why? Because Srikandha is not good for the farmers. It is good for the forest. It is good for the forest. It is good for the forest because it does not require special care and maintenance. It does not require water. It does not require labor. It does not require labor. In the worst case, if the good water is used, the only solution is Srikandha. That is why I tell the farmers, do what you do, do it technically. Do not go to the water. Then you should not give water to the farmers. It should not be more than Srikandha. Because if you give water to the farmers, what will happen if the Srikandha is more than Srikandha? If we give water to the farmers, the farmers should be more than Srikandha. The farmers should be more than Srikandha. If we give water to the farmers, the Srikandha should be more than Srikandha. Because the sun does not rise. There is no need to be a scientist for this. We are doing our own work by working in the forest. That is why I tell the farmers, if you want to work in the forest, I have planted Srikandha. I am not saying that I am a pioneer in the forest. But I will tell you one thing, I will tell you one thing, I will tell you one thing, I have experienced a lot in my 10 years journey. I tell the farmers, I was not a pioneer. I will not give you any chance. Because I have been thinking about it for a long time. I have been thinking about how to manage the host, how to manage the water, how to control the pest, how to give nutrition. I have been thinking about how to give nutrition to all this. I have been thinking about it for a long time. I tell the farmers, if we do something like Facebook, YouTube, I feel that we will not get much success. We will not get soil.

outside there was a small road on the side of the road it was very narrow we had to walk on the side of the road thats how it was we had tried for years to get to this level oh really yes we couldnt feel anything we didnt have a light to go outside when we started no electricity no we started the same way people were afraid that we might die here there was such a situation we didnt have anything i had to get a bottle of water from the village there was no water it was completely empty empty there was nothing there was no parallel land there was only stones and stones we had to level it completely we got to this level we did it from the year of to we did it from to thousand meters within acres within inch of water we didnt have water to drink we had water in the bottom of the bottle we did it within inch of water within acres yes within acres within inch of water yes you are an infosys employee yes it is true what is your qualification i completed my diploma in computer science i completed my ma in sociology from karnataka university i completed my ma in sociology from karnataka university i had a programming skill i was selected as a programmer but i didnt have the opportunity to work outside my husbands house i didnt get a job when i thought about what i should do i was in between walls i wanted to live in my own world i wanted to achieve something when i asked my husband he said i will be a lawyer i will do anything i can i knew that the temperature here is degrees i didnt have the courage to go outside i didnt have the courage to go outside it was very difficult to accept such a challenge in this temperature it was very difficult to accept such a challenge in this temperature i accepted it and started i faced many problems i had a different desire i had a different desire i had a different desire i saw that day i did everything and showed it did you feel happy no sir i did not have any none nowhere was a home or thought of any other way hence it was not very hot here they were making some temperature the land was not so fertile there was no source of water at that time i wanted to make my use of it i made dalimba first its own land agriculture and then we do this not the right cultivation method we have to try something different thats what i planned sir horticulture agroforestry and animal husbandry what did you do agriculture for the gardeners both agriculture and animal husbandry because we didnt do it alone sir because what i did for monocropping was different singlebillet yes now i have done integrated farming sir in the same way what happens in that sir in the same way we are doing different things we are combining all the cultures sir thats why we are doing this what we do in the same way in this there is agriculture sir there is farming there is agroforestry there is animal husbandry why i am saying this is because agriculture is shortterm for example the days months life is months sir it can be a pair a pair of hair a pair of horns a pair of shoulders a pair of legs a pair of legs a pair of hands thats agriculture this is agriculture shortterm and what i have done in that is i have done horticulture that is midterm that means from to years it is growing and growing for example if we do it in the name it can be reduced from acre to to tons in a year we do it in the name sir it can be l taiwan pink taiwan white it will come soon if we do it in the name it will come in years sir it can be kesar dashari mallika banganpalli i have done varieties of mangoes sir if we do it in the name it will not come in year it will fluctuate it can be in a climatical condition or it can be in practices we have done the name mango apple betel nut water rice curry lime and mace that is the method of growing based on the season every season should be different i have grown the tree i am telling everyone that i have grown the tree in karnataka but since the beginning we have not seen the tree for years because we are all in the midterm we have a life of struggle it is not a poem it is a story of all karnataka and indian writers why i am telling this is because srikandha is a very important tree it is grown in the ashray of beria so if we want to plant a tree we should plant srikandha srikandha is a very important tree it is a parasite it requires the host so if we want to host it no matter how much we have to host it srikandha should be a good food for us we should support srikandha and we should be a product of it the farmer should be successful how does a farmers life go if he has been doing srikandha for years for example i have brought a boy from to years old i have brought him to the farm to do the farming he asks me one question he says he gets salary in a month and retirement pension in a month this system is set for that agriculture horticulture agroforestry animal husbandry four combinations we have planned all the combinations only then we will not have a problem of planting srikandha in agriculture i have seen that i have practically taken success from that i have seen srikandha from to years old this one i will show you what i have done for the last years srikandha has never grown because srikandha has so many possibilities and responsibilities it has become an extra problem for people it is a mix whatever you take what is the rate of srikandha what is the future what is the use what is the result then the question of being able to get a farmer ready there are many answers many questions that are confusing we have to find out more answers what i tell the farmer is that we have done all the things we have done the work of planting we have done the work of planting we have done the work of planting we have done everything we have seen crore per acre we have not seen it none of us have seen it that is the truth then if we talk about the farm there are no pictures of the farm that we see this is a terrible truth what a terrible truth you are not famous on youtube or facebook youtube and facebook show colourful pictures the farmers life is not that colourful it is very scary how scary is it today we talk about tractors one tractor costs to rupees one cow i will get one cow one cow costs rupees one cow costs rupees one cow costs rupees we dont have the money to pay the rent because we have to pay the rent we have to pay the rent after doing all these things what do we get in the end what do we get in the end what do we get in the end because the farmers will pay the rent because the farmers will pay the rent because that is our new year we will pay the rent we have spent so much money we will get what we need what do we get in the end we get a flop we get a record of the year because the cost of cultivation is getting lower because the cost of cultivation is getting lower the income is getting lower the income is getting lower because of agriculture that is getting less because they both are not proportional to each other we should think about that we should think about that the prime minister narendra modi said the prime minister narendra modi said in we should double the income if the income is zero if the income is zero it will be zero it will be double zero if we multiply zero into zero if we multiply zero into zero it is zero only it cant be infinite if we want to go to infinity this is the right time to think about it this is the right time that is why i say the land is in our hands because every year people are getting it the land is getting it isnt it that is enough that is where it is if we want to go to the land if we want to start that if we want to start that the creativity should come from the youngsters because our knife is over tomorrow your hand is in our hands that is why today i will tell you what grow forestry is it has become the need of the day it has become the need of the day because what everyone says we are calculating this for msp minimum supportive price minimum supportive price minimum supporting price we are considering that what do you consider in that you the government we people the people our work our expenses our food medicine cow dung how much it costs that is what everyone considers for msp and our land is destroyed you are saying that because there is no land you tell me even if there is land you will cultivate it if there is no land you will be living in cities you will not live in a sq ft with a single bedroom and where will our land be destroyed where will our rental charges be where will our rental charges be there is no way to do that you tell me no one is counting that i selected agroforestry to count that i told you this is srikanths long term crop i told you we have been planting srikanth since how much land will be destroyed till then it is a dead investment dead investment sir to destroy that land to make it a better place i was supporting agroforestry why i am supporting agroforestry because we are planting srikanth you know that it will not be done soon we have to sleep for years if we have to sleep for years the farmer should be strong and have a strong will for that i have created a farm we have planted sita maa perla in to acres we have planted srikanth maa perla sita bettenellika neerlan hunsian limba kariba nugyekaya teng sagwani single square feet of your land should not be wasted it has the value every inch has value yes i have done that you may see it practically single square feet of your land should not be wasted i am working on that sir and i am working on the project to try to reduce the cost of cultivation you are reducing your agriculture if you spend lakhs and if you spend lakhs you will not be a successful farmer sir lakhs will be spent on food what about the man why should you spend that much that much is enough you should reduce the cost of cultivation if you spend lakhs and get lakhs then you will be profitable then you will be profitable then you will be profitable we should change our vision our thinking sir i will tell you if you want to sell your land if you want to sell it then you should spend rupees if you want to sell it i will give you another chance because you have come here with rupees so what i am saying is earning is not important saving is important so you should not spend your land so much you should reduce the cost and go with nature you should not go against nature you should not go against nature but you should go with nature and do something for the farmer as i do i am doing this with the same effort water is my weakness i knew it from the beginning because this is a farmers land i tried very hard but i could not get water after i knew that water is my weakness i told you seetha pala water rice flour you should not drink water i knew that my weakness you should not drink water your major crop is srikandha when you drink water you will not have any oil the more water you drink the more oil content you will have why because srikandha is not good for the farmers it is good for the forest it is good for the forest it is good for the forest because it does not require special care and maintenance it does not require water it does not require labor it does not require labor in the worst case if the good water is used the only solution is srikandha that is why i tell the farmers do what you do do it technically do not go to the water then you should not give water to the farmers it should not be more than srikandha because if you give water to the farmers what will happen if the srikandha is more than srikandha if we give water to the farmers the farmers should be more than srikandha the farmers should be more than srikandha if we give water to the farmers the srikandha should be more than srikandha because the sun does not rise there is no need to be a scientist for this we are doing our own work by working in the forest that is why i tell the farmers if you want to work in the forest i have planted srikandha i am not saying that i am a pioneer in the forest but i will tell you one thing i will tell you one thing i will tell you one thing i have experienced a lot in my years journey i tell the farmers i was not a pioneer i will not give you any chance because i have been thinking about it for a long time i have been thinking about how to manage the host how to manage the water how to control the pest how to give nutrition i have been thinking about how to give nutrition to all this i have been thinking about it for a long time i tell the farmers if we do something like facebook youtube i feel that we will not get much success we will not get soil we will not get srikandha so you think there is no srikandha no nothing will be developed there should be soil there should be soil with the soil the soil should be ready for each stage the soil should be ready for each stage the soil should be ready for each stage the soil should be ready for each stage you will not get the results you will not get the results you will not get the results if you leave the farm your farm will be like a man if you work as a boss your farm will be like a boss that is my

Red sandal, Godamu. The last train to Andhra to Aranya was the bloodshed in Tamilnadu and Kerala. It was not that easy. The bloodshed was always a big problem for the smugglers. The Andhra government created a special alert system. Two years ago, 20 bloodshedders had died in a shootout called STF. The police and police officers had also died in the shootout. But the bloodshed still hasn't stopped. The last train to Aranya will be bloodshed in other states. We need to plan for that. We need to get the money we have saved and keep it safe. That place is the holy place. The bloodshed in Kattigana-Halli-Shekada is a serious problem for the smugglers. First, the houses of the village were covered with bloodshed and were being murdered. When the Andhra police were in power, the bloodshed was now being covered with blue cloths and the police were being arrested. Now, the blue cloths are being used as a trade. We will visit the village one day to find out how the murders are being committed. Kattigana-Halli is not a big deal for the smugglers. The people are more than one. We were suspicious that the murders were taking place there. When we talked to the people there, we didn't think that there was a dangerous atmosphere there. A group was standing there. We went with them and ran away. We started the business as we needed the money. We slowly made him a trader. Then we saw that Kattigana-Halli is a real business. Can we get the money? The smugglers do it. They take it and do it. It's all a secret. They take it and do it. They believe that they can get it. We don't believe it. Can we get the money? They don't give much. 10% 10% You are from Andhra. What's your name? I'm from Kavvala. I'm a smuggler. I don't know about Andhra. I don't know about Kavvala. I don't know about Andhra. I'll call you if I get the money. The smuggler gave his mobile number. Kattigana-Halli is the place where the smugglers go. We were confident that we would get it. But the smugglers who took me there were afraid. When we called the number he gave his number was switched off. We thought that we could come and get the mobile. We were afraid of him. We were afraid of him. We were afraid that we would be thrown out. We went to Angadiyapalli and in one minute we got the experience that we don't need any enemy. We are going to get our lives. We will ask the smugglers. We were asked the same questions when we went to the water. We were asked the same questions when we went to the water. They were talking in their language. One of them called the smuggler. He said that 20 people were killed by the smugglers. The ones who were killed were the Andhra police or Mahitya Dharars. They were killed first and then killed. We were three and they were 20. What to do? This is the only thing that we were able to do. Go left. Go right. When so many people came to the water we were scared. We tried to escape from them but this was the only way. We went to the water and we were able to escape. We came to the place where our car was parked and started to walk. We thought that we would survive but for a minute we were following another person. We were following the car and we were going to Bangalore because we thought that we would not be able to survive in this story. Four or five bikes were following us. They were following us for about 12 km. We were coming back to Bangalore for our song. But they were not only following us but also putting us in a situation where we would die. Should we just let it go after all this? We will tell you what happened after a short break.

I would have used primary type of branches like venue branches What is the role of the primary host? This fort is supported by the field establishment for two years. One year and two years. Then the host is welcomed. Do you understand? What is the host? Welcome. The host is welcomed. The host is welcomed. The host is welcomed. The host is welcomed. The host is welcomed. The host is welcomed. Do you understand the symptoms? When the host is welcomed, you are welcomed. Next to the host, you are welcomed. You are welcomed. Next to the host, you are welcomed. Next to the host, you are welcomed. Next to the host, you are welcomed. Next to the host, you are welcomed. You have prepared the three host very fast. Because after the primary host is welcomed, the secondary host is connected. Now. If you look at the three host, all the host are welcomed. No host is welcomed. Have you observed? No host is welcomed. Then, the host who is welcomed will connect the host with three host. The host will start in the morning. We are looking at the condition of the host. If you want to suppress the host, you can control the host. You can control the host. You can control the host. You can control the host. One's fetch will be lower than other's. Whoek's fetch will be lower than those of the other species. Other species will bear different advantages. Then, the host will add the host to the rows on the green cover. Then, the host will add the host to the rows on the green cover. This is the initial care cell that you need to do to get a sandal The support of the tree will be there when the morning starts After that, the tree will be there for 8 or 6 years The tree next to it will also go automatically The sandal roots will not be here The roots will start spreading out Once we place it additional 5 metre away it will castle a space Either papaya or two years old roots It will grow and develop The overall size is capable to grow It is better to have a dry land, but it is better to have a dry land. Why? Because, when unwanted weeds come, instead of growing in a new place, we can maintain the tractor and till this year, we can have a stable ground cover and when the sun sets, we can plant a new start and plant a new start and plant a new start, we can plant a new start, we can plant a new start, we can plant a new start, and that is the end. I will explain a little bit. In Jakut, we like to have a dry land, a dry land with soil, and we like to have a dry land, and we like to have a dry land, like in Bijaapur, there is a question, why is it not possible to have a dry land? There is a sandal in the sandal, but what happens there? There is a small clay in the sandal, and when the clay dries, cracks occur. When these cracks occur, the tree's bark is exposed to air, the tree's bark is exposed to air, and the bark is exposed to air, and the bark is exposed to air, and the love is not smiled on, they start to act. sadness comes there. If there is a blood out in the clay, cracks will occur, and the moisture will release, and then will get the chips broken. Do you understand? , . . . . . . . . . . If you are 5-5 meters away from the line, you can get a neem plant ready. Because the root of the crop will go through this line. The root of the crop will be found. The neem plant will also go through this line. If you get a neem plant, you can get it ready. I showed you the photo last time. Did you understand? No, I didn't understand. I told you that no other plant can grow better than this. It will be sanded. If that plant dies, you will not lose it. But if it dies, you will lose it. The plant will die if it dies. The neem plant will die if it dies. Do you understand? The plant will die if it dies. So why should we supply nutrients to it? Please pay attention to that. It has been 5-6 years now. The neem plant is dying. The surrounding trees will die in a few days. The 4 trees in the middle of the field will die. If you grow it for 5 years, it will die. If you don't grow it, it will die. The middle of the field will die. The 4 trees will die. Give a permanent host. The permanent host can be bought or sold. If you have it for 20 years, you can get it. The dwarf varieties will not come. High yielding dwarf varieties. You can buy it and make it ready. Do you understand? If you want to grow forest crops, if you want to grow timber, timber can be grown with sandals. This will give more composition. That is why the primary product is wood. This is the primary product, wood. So there is a combination of two. If you have it for a year, if you have it in Srinivaspur, if you have it in Malikavarati, in Arkanavarati, this wood will not grow. It will give 10 kg of wood. No trouble. No trouble. If you have fruit crops, you will get fruits. No trouble. But if you have tree crops, you can grow it. The next one is Meliadobe. They have shown the Meliadobe side. What happened? Meliadobe will go up. It will get wet for 4-5 years. Sandals need a whistle. If it gets wet, there is no chance for the whistle. If you do something, someone will get it. Let's see, let's put sandals on the side of Meliadobe. Sandals will fall on the ground. When he comes, the sandals will fall on the ground. The sandals will fall on the ground. The sandals will fall on the ground. The sandals will fall on the ground. The top of the sandals will get wet. The rainwater will go inside. If you are in the sun, the water will go inside. If you are in the sun, the water will go inside. The water will go inside. The trees will get wet. So, all these problems are there. Management is very important. So, we have to take care of the trees. If we take care of the trees, we can get the yield. If we take care of the trees, we can get the yield. There is a concept. The string will not work. The string is not sensitive. Even the bark is not damaged. The bark is a protective layer. If you block the bark, there is a chance of it going inside. So, you have to be careful. Even if you are 5-5 meters away, when the branches spread, the tractor movements will stop. If you are okay with the tractor not being damaged, then it is okay. The tractor will damage. There is a road below. If it is damaged, you can stop. Have you heard about Namdhari plantation? Have you heard about the idea of Madhagiri? Have you heard about it? There, for 17 years, we have been doing this. For 17 years, we have been doing videos and taking photos. It is very bad. Because, they expected a 10 kg yield for a tree. It was coming. We have done this. We have not seen the tractor operation. The tree is dead. The tree is dead. The water has entered. The tree is dead. What will you do? I'm listening to you. It is a lesson for us. None of the books have yet come. I saw Cannara, I saw other fields and I spoke to other farmers. I'm listening to you. Because, many questions have not come for the books yet. It is not clear. So, I am listening to you. I'm listening to you. We are listening to you. I'm listening to you. So, we need to be very careful and take precautions, spend a little time every day or once a week, and take a look at the conditions and what is the problem. If you look at it, you will find many solutions in your local.",when you start planting in june you dont know when another rain will come if you dont take this risk you will get a good harvest if the plants are good the water will be good the water will be good if you plant a little bit of fungi on the pesticide you will get a root shock if you plant a little bit of the root shock you will get a root shock if you dont know when the termites will turn yellow andsaend on the fungus that also should be a little bit a fungi side if you spray fungus on the rosen plant you will get a good protection if you were to apply branches i would have used primary type of branches like venue branches what is the role of the primary host this fort is supported by the field establishment for two years one year and two years then the host is welcomed do you understand what is the host welcome the host is welcomed the host is welcomed the host is welcomed the host is welcomed the host is welcomed the host is welcomed do you understand the symptoms when the host is welcomed you are welcomed next to the host you are welcomed you are welcomed next to the host you are welcomed next to the host you are welcomed next to the host you are welcomed next to the host you are welcomed you have prepared the three host very fast because after the primary host is welcomed the secondary host is connected now if you look at the three host all the host are welcomed no host is welcomed have you observed no host is welcomed then the host who is welcomed will connect the host with three host the host will start in the morning we are looking at the condition of the host if you want to suppress the host you can control the host you can control the host you can control the host you can control the host ones fetch will be lower than others whoeks fetch will be lower than those of the other species other species will bear different advantages then the host will add the host to the rows on the green cover then the host will add the host to the rows on the green cover this is the initial care cell that you need to do to get a sandal the support of the tree will be there when the morning starts after that the tree will be there for or years the tree next to it will also go automatically the sandal roots will not be here the roots will start spreading out once we place it additional metre away it will castle a space either papaya or two years old roots it will grow and develop the overall size is capable to grow it is better to have a dry land but it is better to have a dry land why because when unwanted weeds come instead of growing in a new place we can maintain the tractor and till this year we can have a stable ground cover and when the sun sets we can plant a new start and plant a new start and plant a new start we can plant a new start we can plant a new start we can plant a new start and that is the end i will explain a little bit in jakut we like to have a dry land a dry land with soil and we like to have a dry land and we like to have a dry land like in bijaapur there is a question why is it not possible to have a dry land there is a sandal in the sandal but what happens there there is a small clay in the sandal and when the clay dries cracks occur when these cracks occur the trees bark is exposed to air the trees bark is exposed to air and the bark is exposed to air and the bark is exposed to air and the love is not smiled on they start to act sadness comes there if there is a blood out in the clay cracks will occur and the moisture will release and then will get the chips broken do you understand if you are meters away from the line you can get a neem plant ready because the root of the crop will go through this line the root of the crop will be found the neem plant will also go through this line if you get a neem plant you can get it ready i showed you the photo last time did you understand no i didnt understand i told you that no other plant can grow better than this it will be sanded if that plant dies you will not lose it but if it dies you will lose it the plant will die if it dies the neem plant will die if it dies do you understand the plant will die if it dies so why should we supply nutrients to it please pay attention to that it has been years now the neem plant is dying the surrounding trees will die in a few days the trees in the middle of the field will die if you grow it for years it will die if you dont grow it it will die the middle of the field will die the trees will die give a permanent host the permanent host can be bought or sold if you have it for years you can get it the dwarf varieties will not come high yielding dwarf varieties you can buy it and make it ready do you understand if you want to grow forest crops if you want to grow timber timber can be grown with sandals this will give more composition that is why the primary product is wood this is the primary product wood so there is a combination of two if you have it for a year if you have it in srinivaspur if you have it in malikavarati in arkanavarati this wood will not grow it will give kg of wood no trouble no trouble if you have fruit crops you will get fruits no trouble but if you have tree crops you can grow it the next one is meliadobe they have shown the meliadobe side what happened meliadobe will go up it will

Chandasekar was my classmate. His son, Abha Vishwa, is the person who acted in that case. We all trust him. Sundar is the only son. He's a software engineer. He's a young boy. Udda, he's a boy named Udda. He's a 6 feet tall boy. He's a 6 feet tall Udda. He's a very amazing artist. He's played in the Kempammana court case. He directed a short film. It was a great short film. It was a great short film. What was the name of the film? It was called Reckoning. Reckoning. I didn't understand English. I was in 8th grade. It was a great film. Now, Sanjay Shantaram, the father of our Swami Ayyappa film, Ayyappa Swami, was in the film. He was the leading actor in the film, in the film, Manne Kempe Gowda. He had a wonderful performance. I went to his memorial and I advised him for the first time. It's very easy for those who know dance and recording. But if you enter a battlefield and meet the battlefield, it will be very nice. You will be able to accept the acting more. I advised him to learn different techniques. Now, my other disciple, my younger one, Vivekanth Bagalkoti, he's a software engineer. He's directing a film called Kushmanda Roopa. In that film, he's one of the heroes. He can be a second hero or anti-hero. What do you think about Kushmanda Roopa? You've worked for two days, right? When I saw Kushmanda Roopa, I told him a lot of stories. I didn't tell him the whole story. Because he didn't like to leave the story. How old are you with your father? Chandanavanna Fort. You were going to find water from the bottom. I saw it in my dream. To save the animals from gunfire, you and your father made cement blocks in the ground. We built a fort for each other. Veera shot all that. It's amazing. How did you come up with the idea of forming a forest? Are you more interested in the forest? After the kids play, the kids will be like this. How do you feel about building a water source on the top of the fort? The history of the fort is about 10-12 years. You said 14 years. We built a fort. We built a fort and watered it for 12 years. There were no facilities for water. My father used to cut the trees and water the forest. We used to cut the trees for 6 acres. Now everything is checked down. We have two motors. Water comes to rest. There is no problem with that. Water comes and it gets light. Now there are many problems with the rocks. What we know is that we put the water in the corners. In the corners, someone put a layer of water in the center. We knew how much water we could get. They were checking it. Since then, my father and I thought about it. We thought about putting sensors in it. But there was no sensor supply. We thought about what we could do with it. So, my father and I came up with an idea. We made 8K blocks. We thought it would be cheaper than building a fort. We produced 50 to 60 feet of wood per week. We have put 150 blocks of wood per week. We have made cement, concrete and so on. We have made a fort for the rest of the day. We have made it strong. You have built a fort. Only rainwater goes there. You are not using soil. We have to give space for the water to rise. We have left one foot apart. There should be space for the rainwater to rise. Apart from farming, apart from farming, Do you want to move forward in cinema? Or do you want to continue in your software? Or do you want to continue in your work? What is your goal? If you say software, we don't outsource. We have made a product called TV Connect.

SandalWoodNewsStories_282,"Now what has happened is, if someone is lying down, if he has a tractor, he will call someone and pull out the seeds here. There is no seed left. He will pull out the tractor. He will spray a chemical. He doesn't know what those chemicals are. Why is he scared? He is scared because of heat. It's not heat.

There is no tension. There is no target. There is no fire. There is nothing. Nothing. But, if there is no work, agriculture is a loss. Work is a loss. I have discussed this much. I need a plan. I need a long-term plan. I need a short-term plan. What I am saying is, immediately I will take the pen and put a bundle and I will work on it day and night. I will work on it day and night. Step by step. I need a little time, I need to work on it from the beginning. But, I am very peaceful today. I have a system. You have seen it yourself. I have not done anything at this time. You have not done anything at this time? Already, I have done more than 50%. At that time, natural regeneration is happening here. After that, I am getting a good result from my work. What happens here is, once it starts, I will sing De Nevala Jebi Deta Deta Chapad. It is like that. If you hit, it will not come back. But, I need time. What I am doing now is, I have started working on it. I will not say that I will stop working this year. I am working on it for 20 years. I have 20 years of experience. Today, for my 20 years of experience, I am getting a lot. Is it possible to work on that? It is possible. It is possible to do it in any way. It is possible. In any way. It is possible to do it with any method. It is possible. I have not done magic or something immediately. I have not done anything. I think we should improve this more You have not done it yet? There is 90% left Oh We have to do a lot of work We have to do a lot of work on agriculture So agriculture is a very interesting field in all other fields Very interesting In this world Any job, any profession With a good life A healthy life A good life A good life Agriculture is the only thing that gives Agriculture is the only thing that gives Agriculture is the only thing that gives There are two types of health and spirituality There is a good life There is a healthy life There is a healthy life My food I am going here I am going here We have a lot of unplanned trips I am spending time with family I am spending time with family I am spending time with family I am spending time with family This is a chance This is a chance That is an opportunity for the family. There is no plan. We went last time. We went to some beach. We went to the Galyar garden. They were busy with pending, they never came. We came to Naka, but they never came. We went to the Galyar garden. How are the gardens in Mallinadi? How is their farming? There is a farming there. We came to see everything. It is a very special temple. It is amazing. We went there. We stayed there. Our family, our children stayed there. It is a big temple. I am not sure if it is because I am sleeping in the same place as my family. I am sleeping in a small temple. It is a historical place. I am not sure if it is because I am sleeping in a sacred place. This is a wonderful tradition. Those who have not seen it, should experience it. Experience it. I cannot express it. The tradition is the farming tradition. There is no other tradition. It is a special place. We have built a temple in Bisilnadi. It is called Sadhya. You can see the temple here. It is a beautiful place. Can you build it in small size? Yes, we can. You have built a small temple. But the small people can build it. They can do it better. It is a small and beautiful world. It is a big world. It is a 100 acres of land. But it can be built in 2-3 acres of land. We can build a forest in 10 acres. It is possible. We can build a forest in 1 acre. We can build a forest in 1 acre. It is possible. We can build a forest in 1 acre. A family forest. It is possible. We can build a forest in many different areas. We can build a forest in the form of a stone. It is possible. It is not possible for the poor. I have not built a big temple. I have not spent millions to build a palace. I have not done any Israel's technology. I have nothing. It is a small thing. You should know do's and don'ts. If you do this, what will happen? If you do this, what will happen? You can gain something. What our raitras are doing is that they are doing what they can and they are doing it. They are doing it out of some trouble. Traditional method is ultimate. But we have already come a long way in our tradition. We have already come a long way. Our life is like this. We don't need any wood. We don't need any smell. We don't need any wood or any wood. Our song is like this. We get the coconut from the king and we strike. Our grandfather Muthajja, as a tradition, used to plant the best seeds in the year before. This year he was doing a strike. He used to plant the seeds in the morning? Yes. He used to plant the seeds that he needed in the year before. All the seeds, Dweela, Akadi Kali, Jola, Sajje, all the seeds, N.A seeds, even the small seeds, were all planted in the year before. What is happening now is that if there are four seeds in the next year, the coconut will be taken away today. If there are tractors, he will call someone and say that the seeds are not growing. The tractor will be taken away. He doesn't have a plan. If he doesn't have a plan, he won't take it seriously. He is sad. He is not excited. That is the situation. Already, we are taking money from the land. As a part of the industry, the cost of living is decreasing. The soil is getting worse. The moisture holding capacity is getting worse. The earth is losing the power to hold the soil. At the same time, the earth is losing the power to hold the soil. Now, it is the time to eat biscuits and bread. These are processed foods. Chips, lez, this is the symbol of our culture. We have become modernized. Life is going on like this. It is like this. The people of Rasayana. The agriculture after the 60s, is called the agriculture of the Gondas. It is not the agriculture of the Rasayana, it is the agriculture of the Gondas. Today, the farmer, I will take a picture. The farmer is spraying chemicals. He does not know what those chemicals are. He does not know what the government, the farmer and our industry are. He does not know what insecticide is being used. What contact insecticide or systemic insecticide or what fungicide is being used. He does not know. We are going to a meditation, a meditation session. What will happen? If one plant is grown, in 100 acres, one is 90 acres of waste. But, the plant has already been destroyed. It is not the same as the other plants. It is the same as the other plants. It is the same as the other plants. It is the same as the other plants. It is already a mistake. It needs to be developed. Otherwise, the farmer will become more serious. The farmer will become more serious. The farmer has already grown the crops and the crops with the help of the farmers. The farmer cannot even afford to buy a small market. We are very sorry for this. We are very sorry for this. We should not underestimate the pesticides. We should not underestimate the pesticides. We should think seriously about the pesticides, the benefits and the disadvantages. That is why he was born. That is why he was born. But, the pesticides, today, the NPK, the micro nutrients, the stimulants, insecticides, pesticides, stimulants, what is this? This is all long term and short term. These are the benefits and disadvantages. This is the full power to understand the work of a common citizen and the government and the jobless people. We should make the system. The work of the soul is not enough. What is happening today? I don't know if it is the MRL. What is MRL? What is happening today? A proclaim sprays, or a carbon spray, a methamyl spray, a spray today, and then it is harvested in the evening and then it is brought to the market. It is a methamyl. It is 90 days. Maximum residue limit. It is not eaten for 90 days. But, the next day it is being brought to the market. We, our children, our family eat it. We think it is fresh, shiny, and good. We eat it for 2-3 days and then we get scared. It is not eaten. The methamyl spray is given. The cancer is curled. This is happening. He doesn't know, Papa. He doesn't know that he has to harvest for 90 days. He doesn't know. When the spray is done, he says that the chemicals will kill the cancer. He wants the medicine. He wants it to be strong. He will come to my place the next day when the cancer is done. He will ask, are you doing the spray now? How many days are you harvesting? Who knows? Who has the answer? Where is the person who knows the answer? He gave the money, the methamyl spray, he hit him, he died inside, he didn't have any inside, he did the harvesting, he gave it to the people. We are all related to him. We all take it, and say that it is shiny, and good, and give it to him. We have taken our children and all the elderly and the elderly and we are taking that. It is not enough to do that. It is the power of God. He is a young man. What are the educational programs? What are the awareness programs? It is not possible. We need that. This is the seed, sir. This is the seed.

SandalWoodNewsStories_287,"Namaskar! Welcome to Atmeyar Raitar with Sanchi TV News. Today we have come to Kottalagi village. We have come to the village of Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Till today, the situation has been like this. There were two Srikandada Gidakala on the hill. We don't know when they will take them away from the stone. But in the Taluka of Belagav district, in Kottalagi village, one farmer left all the traditional fields and started a Srikandada farm. That too in Hattuekara. Come and get to know that farmer. And also come and get to know all the Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Come and get to know the farmer first. My name is Sidra Irapa, from L.D. I am from Belagavanjala, in the Taluka of Atmeyar Raitar, Kottalagi. I used to do farming. My ancestors used to do farming. Later I started farming. How did you get the idea to start a Srikandada Gidakala farm? Now, if we want to start a Srikandada farm, it will be done on its own. Because, when we do it on our own, we are doing it by ourselves. The labor rate has increased. The rate of cow dung has increased. The rate of medicine has increased. Now, in terms of investment, in the absence of work, the situation has become like this. Now, Menaka Nagamma's family, if they have their own family, they can work and earn their living. Now, we have to work like this. If we have to water the fields, we have to work from the side. We have to work from the side. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. How many acres of Srikandada Gidakala have you planted? How many trees have you planted in one acre? How many trees have you planted in the middle? I planted Srikandada Gidakala in 10 acres of land. In total, I planted 80 acres of land. In 80 acres, I have planted 10-15% of the land. Now, in one acre, I have planted 325 trees. How much is the difference? There are 16 trees on one side and 8 trees on the other side. Now, I have planted 300 trees. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. I have been planting trees for the past 2-3 years. It has been 3 years. If we plant trees in the front, it will take 2-3 years. We have been planting trees for 1 year. If we look at the trees in the front, it is not easy to plant trees. The trees in the back are not in good condition. I have planted a tree in the front. The tree is in a bad condition. I have been planting trees for 3-4 years. That has been the reason why I am here. I am here to help the people of Srikandada. I have brought this tree to this house. I have brought this tree to this house. I have brought this tree to this house. In Srikandada, how many races are there in the trees? Which races have you killed? How do you organize them? What do you do in Srikandada? When we go to Srikandada, it is different races. We have one race. This is the only Srikandada that we have in a country. This is the only tree we have in Srikandada. In Srikandada, here is the base tree. In Srikandada, we have a different tree. A bad tree. We have a hard tree here. This tree is very soft. Its roots grow very fast. But when they go abroad, they go to Canada and they grow. They make a difference there. They grow different plants. They grow more than 20% of the plants. They grow on their soil and on their climate. What are the medicines used for the plants of Srikanth? Now, the soil of Srikanth is soft. The soil is soft and the plants are soft. Then the plants are not ready. The plants are not ready. In Malinak, there is a place called Nelkut. It is 21% of the plants. Here, the plants are growing well. The more the plants grow, the better the plants are. The plants are ready in the fields. There are 8 small plants in the field. That is one of the reasons. How long does the water stay there? For the plants, the water needs to be kept for compulsory 7 years. The water is kept for 7 days. How long does the water stay there? The water is kept for 7 days. For 7 days, the water is kept for 1 hour. It is kept in the basi-git. It is kept in the basi-git for 3-4 months. How do you make the medicine? There is no need for any other medicine. We just make it in small pieces. We make it in small pieces. We make paste for that. We make paste of rice and wheat. We make paste and then we make it into a paste. We make paste once a year. There is no need for any other medicine. There is no need for anything else. What is the need for the Srikandakida plant? What is the profit? We have done a little research on the Srikandakida plant. But we have not done any research on that. We have asked the market. We have asked the government to do some research. They say that the plant can grow up to 20,000-24,000 kg. When I went to get the pet plant, I found out that Sirig anda heard about the Srikandika plant. Our national training was given by lassen for the non- seinike plant. This was given to us for private streets corrupting ourselves. But today we have to stay for 13 years. When we cut thiselovern for 13 years, we think their land will be Aíَśē. If we could ensure that the cost would be Rs 200,000, we would be then able to do more research. How long will it take to earn 16 years? It will take 16 years. For 16 years, we can earn 1 lakh rupees. We can earn 1 lakh easily. If you don't earn more than 16 years, you will earn 10% more in a year. If you don't earn more than 18 years, you will earn 1 lakh rupees in 25 years. For 16 years, you earn 1 lakh rupees. For 25 years, you earn 1 lakh rupees. This is the Srikanda. We have cut it. If we don't earn more than 16 years, we can earn 1 lakh rupees. Who has allowed you to do this? We don't need any permission. Our farmers don't have any information about this. The government has given us permission to do this for the last 7 years. But our farmers don't have any permission. We have been here for 8 years. Our farmers don't have any information about this. So, we request the TV channel to give us permission to do this and we will give you permission. Why? We have given you 20,000 rupees. If anyone has any information, you can contact us. This is our Chitradur. We have cut the road in front of us. We have sold our land to the farmers. We have cut the road in front of us. They have given information to others. We request the TV channel to give us permission to do this and we will give you permission. Have you ever cut the road in Srikandha? This is the Srikandha Sawolambi forest. This is Paravolambi forest. This is Chogisidhar. This is the forest. Where did you cut it? This is the forest. 5 years ago, they used to plant trees on this. Now, they need a support dander. They have given support dander here. They need another 3-4 years. They have planted another forest here. This forest is good. It is not bad. When did you plant it? We used to plant it in the morning. But, the forest did not grow well. The forest did not grow well.

SandalWoodNewsStories_6,"A complete video about Blackwood will be uploaded. Many people have doubts about how to build it and where to build it. We will talk about that in the next video. Since we are making a video today, this is a very important video. We will discuss about the damage done in the last 3 years. How the sand was taken by the people who walked around the area in the last 3 years. Let's talk to this farmer. Basically, it's been 3 years. Yes, 3 years. How deep is it? Nearly about 1 feet. More than 1 feet. The main reason is the host. Here is the bunny. We showed in the last video how the bunny was taken down. It was sitting alone. Today, you can see that it is lying down. It is locked. Basically, what is happening here is that it is not planned to be put down. It is naturally taken down. But there is a tree there. You can see that. 3 feet. This is the key. This is also 3 years old. People don't believe it. I am not saying this. That's why I am asking the writer. Sir, come here. Please give an introduction. Basically, he is an agri diploma. He is a full-time farming type. The people who are interested in this are 11 acres. They are developing one acre. Please give an introduction about when and where you started. My name is Vishwanath Nagar. I am from Balakot district. This is 11 acres of land. We have grown rice and vegetables here. Next, we have a lime tree. This is a lime tree. Next, we have a palm tree. Next, we have a coconut tree. Next, we have a coconut tree. Next, we have a palm tree. Next, we have a palm tree. Next, we have a palm tree. werden goes, sago is there. Now... Our season four lamp Our season four lamp They have started from there. This is to buy a dontary Next, in 2019 started to be a three player for our two nom getirables here Another one was there and There is a tea plot in the forest. They have brought tea for tea. Forest department. Sandals are also there. They have brought tea from the forest. Along with this, they are growing rice. What is the difference between the tea and the smell? Sir, the smell is 10 feet. 10 feet sandal to sandal. Row to row space is same. 10 bettons means 430 plants per acre. In between, they are growing rice. That is 5 feet. 5 feet. They have planted a rice plant every 5 feet. That is also started from 2019. It is same. It is one year before that. Rice plant. They have planted rice first. That is 10 feet. In between, they are growing sandal. So, plant to plant. Each plant has 5 feet. But, 10 feet of rice is 10 feet of rice. Then, the first host is What did they give? Togari. It is one year later. Togari has planted rice for one year. Then, they have planted this. Come, let us see the garden. It is one year. It is not good. It is not good. It is not good. It is not good. It is not good. It is not good. It is not good. It is not good. It is 3 and half years. 4 years. It is 2019. You can see the growth. It is 4 years. We have decided. It is not completed. Within 4 years, it is a good growth. What we are planning for this? We are planning to give another host. But, along with that, we are planning for stress management. Because, the better the growth, the better the heart would be. When there is excess growth, heart formation will be lessened. The reason is tissues do not break down. Secondary metabolism is the tissue that is developed, which breaks down and heart formation is constant stress. Consistency is constant. You should be constantly stressed. You will be exhausted. If you get tired of the work, before that, after 12 years, if you have targeted it, if you want to cut it, then there is a chance of heart problem. It is extremely healthy. It is good in the initial stage. But, maintaining it like that is wrong. That is why, we are discussing what to do with secondary metabolism. Let us see. What these trees have done is simple. They have drained the extreme nutrients from sand. It seems that all trees are being drained from other trees. I will put some different species of trees. You can see here. This tree is almost 4 and half years old. That is 3 and half years. These 3 and half years old trees have already taken all the energy to grow. You can see the other side. Almost everything here is healthy. The smell is healthy and strong. That is called the marine or the mother. Basically, this is what is left here. If there is no secondary host, we plan to give a permanent host. We have given some vermi compost. We have given some coconut. One advantage is that it has grown already for 1 year. It has grown 3-4 feet. Left-right. After 1 year, we have taken it. After 1 year, we have taken it. After pruning, it has grown again. We have pruned it and that is the same. You have not given anything to the root zone. No fertilizer. We have done irrigation. We have done it in summer. We have done it in summer. In June, July, August, we have not given water. In summer, we have not given water. We have given water once or twice. What I am saying is that the leaf density is very low. If you want to see the difference between the two trees, look at this tree. There are many leaves in this tree. Even if there are only two trees, the activity of photosynthesis will definitely be less in this tree. If the age is like this, the growth will be stunted. It will be very less. The size of the leaves will also be bigger. The length and comparison. If you want to see the difference, boost up the soil. Boost up the soil. You will know the size of the leaves. There are some drops here. Here, full leaf drops. Ok. In another year, all this will go to your tree. It will go to Malabari. If we cut it now, it will come back. It is not small to make a phone call. It is not that big. Ok. What tree? There is a tree in the other side. Which side? The one in the middle. The one in the middle. We have done the phone call. We have a lot of problems. All the trees are dead. All the trees are dead. We have to cut them all. We have to cut them all. We have to cut them all. Ok. Malabari has been cut. You have already seen. They have grown with the smell. The smell in the forest is weak. But here, the border is visible. The trees on the right side. Why is it so beautiful? The answer is the light. The light is very important. If we want to grow a smell, we have to plan it from the beginning. That is why we are making this video. The host is not enough. You are watching. This is our tree and our bunny. It is so beautiful. Two reasons. One, the bunny tree is big. So, it gets more nutrients. It gets more energy. And it gets more light. So, it has been growing for 3 years. It is 1 feet tall. If we try it, it is the lowest number. I always say, do not cut it in 1 foot. It is not important to cut it in 1000 feet. You can cut it in 100 feet or 100 feet. You can make it in a good size. Or you can make it in a good shape. The purpose of this video is to give the farmers a little knowledge. The farmers need to get some help. The host needs to get the light, nutrients and the three main numbers. Do not go over the numbers. Do not put it in 1 foot or 600 feet. They have put it in 400 feet. The results are not there. The host is dying. Please remember this. Let us continue the video. Bunny. Now, we are checking the micro nutrients. Did you give the beetroot? Yes. Now, we are checking the DAPS. We gave only one. Then, nothing else.",a complete video about blackwood will be uploaded many people have doubts about how to build it and where to build it we will talk about that in the next video since we are making

I have done it For me it is the same I am a tall man My father-in-law came down to me My younger brother came down My uncle came down The soil is not good for the ants My uncle said I will give you sugar I will give you 20 to 30 drops I will give you a rate I will give you a rate What did I say? What did I say? If you give it to the birds The birds will not eat it Will the birds eat it? Will the birds eat it? Will the birds eat it? I said yes He said no He said he will give it to the birds I said yes I did not say anything before I said that the birds will eat it I said yes Otherwise they will sit and eat it Otherwise they will sit and eat it I came to Valladumara I will give you a rate I will give you a rate I have more I have more money They say that we will bring a lot of money Good idea Then They will take a lot Exactly I did not say anything before I said that you are a good man I said yes What is my intention? I want to build a sea I want to build a sea I want to take that sea to these beautiful animals I want to be a earthling I had a lot of money I did not know that I spent 500 rupees on this I was living with 1000 rupees But that was my profit If I had 500 rupees, I would have made 500 rupees profit What is my intention? Where is that? There is another question I will put the sea I will put the sea Do you want to build a sea? What I am saying is I have a house My son is from a small family He can get fruits He can get working capital He can get a lot of resources If he has 4 acres of land He can cultivate 3 acres of land He can cultivate one acre of land He can grow 3 crore trees or he can grow a FDT He can build a lot of houses If there are any problems in the family, then the income from that problem can be considered as a financial strength. Why shouldn't it be done? Why shouldn't it be done? Why shouldn't the farmer come as a reserve? A paan shop owner would have to pay 20 rupees a day for a pigmy. He would have to pay 100 rupees a day for a pigmy. A cutting shop owner would have to pay 100 rupees a day for a savings. But if there is a land of 16 acres and a 48 acres, then there is a savings of one day of the pigmy. The land is not cut, but the water is cut. The water is cut. That's what I am saying. If there are any problems in the family, if there are any problems in the family, then the income from that problem can be considered as a financial strength. So, what I am saying is, we are all second generation. We are all second generation. We are all second generation in farming and agriculture. We are all second generation in farming and agriculture. Our fathers, if we want to be good, then they have to work hard. We are living the result of their hard work. If they had worked hard, then they would have been able to grow 3 acres of land in 4 acres of land. I don't think they would have done much if they had done 100 acres. They would have been able to grow 1 fourth of the land in 4 acres. It is a real farming. Not just Srikandha, give Srikandha a 300 acres. Put different things in it. Put the name, water, lime, citaph, curry leaves. If you put a 300 acres, then we have not discussed anything. If you put a 300 acres, then it is 50 lakhs for 300 acres. If you put a 300 acres, it is 3 crores. If 300 acres is 3 crores, then I will have a dream. I don't need a dream. I need a dream to do something. You need a dream to talk. I need a dream. That gives me strength. I don't have money in my pocket. I have a dream. That gives me strength. I have a lot of money in my pocket. You don't have a dream. I don't have any hope. I will dream. I have no dream. I have no desire to talk. I have a dream. I will dream. He will dream for 1-2 hours in the morning and 5 hours in the night. He will dream. I will dream. I will dream. I will dream. I will dream. So, what I am saying is, I will get a dream visa. I will have a permanent relationship with the farmers. Different organizations will come, 100 or 100 farmers will come. They will come and work. Every three weeks, we have a group discussion. Every farmer will have problems with agriculture. What are the do's and don'ts? That's it. So, what I am saying is, every three weeks, at 9 am, we have a discussion about agriculture. Every three weeks, we have a discussion. We will give them food, feed them, free of cost. Every three weeks, we have a discussion. What I am saying is, if you have a dream visa, you can get 3 acres of land. Out of 4 acres, you can get 1 acre of land. You can do agriculture. 3 acres, what can you do? Seed production, oil, vegetables, floriculture, anything. You can do anything. 1 acre of land. You can get 1 acre of land. You can get 1 acre of land. You can get 1 acre of land. You can get 1 acre of land. You can plant prefer fruit. You can plant the sesame seeds. Different types of seeds. You can plant 300 sri ganda. In a year, that would mean more than 15 or 20 years. That would mean more than 15 or 20 years. We have a discussion. For a seed, you need 10 kg corn. In the year of 15, you need 10 kg corn. Within that, if you have 4% oil content, you need 10,000 rupees per kilo. KG. One lakhs is one crore. Three hundred crores. Three crores. What I am saying is, if you think about it, how can you put three crores as a state bank in the future of our family? If any unforeseen events happen to our family, if any disaster happens to our family, the economic power that comes from that disaster, if it is one day, it will be six years, eight years. Then, a wave of waves comes to your land. A wave comes to your land. There was a wave coming. A man from Munnur, eight years old, had a farm in Srikanth. A very strong self-confidence comes to you, a message to the society comes. After ten years, so many CCTV cameras, so many dogs, our little dogs, we will put them in the mud, we don't have to import dogs. We don't have to buy meat. We don't have to import dogs. We will put our little dogs in a dog's mouth, put the camera around them, and put them in the mud. Live fencing and windbreaker. It will take fifteen years, sixteen years, it will take three crores. What I dream of is, I will build a white house for one crore. For our small people. For a happy life, a happy life, a happy life. We should live only in our own. Our children, our parents, our parents should live in that house. A house for one crore. A life of good character. A life of self-respect. We should have that one real vision. One crore is a house. If you pay fifty lakhs, you get one kilo of gold. After two, you get one kg of gold. Our farmers should be reminded that they get one kg of gold. Why am I saying this? If they are doing it alone, if they are doing it for the sake of agriculture, they won't get anything. But we are saving our land. What? The farmers themselves. The land of the country. The land of the country. More than a crore of education, there is a lot of education. Victory to the farmers. Victory to the farmers. Victory to the farmers. Victory to the farmers. Victory to the farmers. But what is actually happening? The farmers are not getting what they are doing for the sake of agriculture. We should change that. How can we change that? If we do it alone, it won't work. We should be aware of that. We should get one kg of gold. We should not be afraid of anything. Even if others say, I am doing this, I will also get one kg of gold. We should be aware of that. One crore of gold. One kg of gold for 50 lakhs. Don't make 50 lakhs as property. Make it as a FD for the children. Don't be afraid to make a crore of property. Make the children property. Give them a good quality education. Give them a good quality education. The children will become property. Two crores. We have reached one crore. Do good business. Do good agriculture. Don't do anything bad. Don't do anything bad to anyone. Don't do anything bad to anyone. Don't do anything bad to anyone. Don't do anything bad to anyone. Either you are doing MLA or MP. White shirt. White pant. White boot. White slippers. They are doing MLA or MLA children. They are doing it like that. They are doing it without asking. They are doing it without asking. Boss, boss. Don't do anything bad. They are doing it like that. They are doing it without asking. They are doing it without asking. They are doing it without asking. We shouldn't do such a bad work. Even the blood of every son of the farmer is the result of his father and mother's hard work. We shouldn't go to such a poor house. So it's a big sin. So don't give money to anyone. Don't go to the self-employed. Don't go to the leader's house. Don't go to the leader's house. We should support the animals and birds. We should give them shelter. We should give them social responsibility. We should create a social job and make them financially happy. There is a financial life. There is a health life. There is a ideal life. Not only that, there is also a spiritual life. When he built a hut in the forest and left the soil and died, he was free to go to the forest. When he left the forest, he was free to go to the forest. He didn't go there. When you build a hut, your children will be born and they will be brought together. The animals and birds will give you shelter. You have built a hut, the animals and birds will give you shelter. The animals and birds will give you shelter and will see your world. They will pray to the Lord. The animals and birds will pray to the Lord. God, give this family good health. God, give this family happiness. God, give this family good life. God, give this family good life. The animals and birds will pray to God. Why do we say, happiness is a curse? Why do we say, more than a million students, there is no such thing as a hut. There is a financial life, health, support and spirituality. So, if we have a small land, we should not build a hut even if it is four acres. It is possible. If we have two acres of land, we should build 20 huts. Our elders say, our scholars say, our religious scholars say, that it is better to build a hut than to build a temple. A temple has a roof, a roof, a roof, a temple, a roof. It has everything. But, a hut is nothing. It does not give water, it does not give rain, it does not give air. The temple is built for the good of the society. It does not mean, that the person who built it will earn a happy life. If you build a hut, you will earn a happy life. this whole place is based in our land if we use our wealth and adorn it with a plastic piece then we can carry on this is not a big landlady I think he is not a good person. But he is capable. His family is different. Now his children are also different. I am already 40 years old. I was born in 1982. Wherever we went, we went here. We went to Belga, Darwada, Ubud. We came here after graduation. We went everywhere. We went to P.V.C, 10th, 10th, 10th grade. Now, we go everywhere. We go to Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhiji, Nathuram, Ghotchan, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Modi. We go everywhere. When we think about our mother, how she raised us, how she lived, how she lived her life, when we think about her children, we don't need anything else. We can build a better humanity. We can build a better humanity. We can't forget that humanity and its evil powers. We can't forget that humanity and its evil powers. We can't forget that humanity and its evil powers. This is a farming family. The reason is, the farming families are the ones who are the most powerful. Even the food they eat is fair. Even the food they eat is the result of the good deeds of the farmers. That's why there is that power. Even if we don't eat much, the farming family will be able to see the good deeds of the farmers. Sometimes they are cheating, sometimes they are trying to get rid of their bad deeds. We don't need to discuss that. You and I know that. But in the middle of all this, we can build a wonderful life. All these problems are in the middle. All these problems are in the middle. All these problems are in the middle. In the middle of all this, we can build a wonderful life. In the middle of all this, we can build a wonderful life. Sir, I forgot my banana. No, sir. I have a small banana. Come, let's have lunch. Come, let's have lunch. He has taken the banana.

Look, in us, there are Beavu, Alasu, Basiru, Banni, Ala, Harali, they are also known as wonderful. That is also a blessing to the living bird, a blessing to the environment. we are all growing here... We should alsoεd text motif your gift. on the Sores Simcula undermine tonight robot What sir? This is Paravalambi Sashi. It is basically semi-root parasite. It is basically parasitic in nature. Paravalambi? Yes, yes. We need to get more support for this. Is it? That's what we are trying. This is Paravalambi Sashi. It is basically semi-root parasite. This is Kuruchala Sashi. Even though there are big trees, but it is a small part of Kannada, Gandha and Chennai. Because the land, water and nature that is found in the whole world, the wonderful, natural environment that is found here, is here. The Udhkustha and Mantra sri ganda that is found here, is not found anywhere. I have grown 100 acres of sri ganda. And now we have 5,000 acres of sri ganda. This is India's biggest sandalwood cluster. Kopalajishti is India's biggest sandalwood cluster. There are three professors. Karnataka, Andhra and Tamilnadu. They are doing Ph.D. here. I will show you all. Today, all this is happening in the Aswara Krantri. This is one work. They are doing a conference on global warming. They are wearing boots and blazers. Some people are rubbing their hands, legs and clothes. This is a difficult work. They are talking and they are doing. About 1000 people are working on the forest. Kopalajillai is not a normal place. From the front, the smell spreads all over the world. This is the main place. Today, the sri ganda of Gunamatta, the soap, cosmetics, perfumes, powders, all products are produced here. The market is getting bigger all over the world. There is such power. We have taken the land of Dalimba from the world and made it into the world. This is the Dalimba headquarters. When you see all this, you will see the great achievements. Today, the world is 5,000 acres of land. We are talking about the current rate. We are giving 15,000 crores of products to the people. That power is in our land. This is the land. It has 5,000 crore worth products. We have a lot of economic life. We need to live a prosperous life. We need to live a life of prosperity. We need to live from that reality. Today, we are doing the sri ganda-based agriculture. We are doing the Sandalwood Centric Agroforestry Model. We are doing this. There is no difficulty in economic life. There is health, vision and spirituality in economic life. We need to give the life of the people, the environment and social responsibility. We need to give the people the social responsibility. We need to give the people the economic responsibility. That is the power. Why are we saying that agriculture is a bad thing? Why are we saying that we are above the education of millions of students? Why? Because in the same period, when we were here, when did we say this? When the computer arrived? It arrived. Today, due to the lack of money, the business is in a bad state. But when it comes to agriculture, we should be very respectful. Because the color of the birds is very low. Look, many public birds are there. Look at the shoes. Here, a cardan is built. If the farmer is living alone, a social responsibility is to take care of the social job. Why did the Corona come today? Why is the breath of the breath being so bad? Why is the cancer so high? It is a self-inflicted crime. Corona is not a problem. We should be able to overcome it. You should study it completely. Corona should come and be seen. We should be able to overcome the power of the Corona. This hybrid food, this pollution, this bad life, we should be able to overcome it. We had Corona for half a century. You will know when you study it deeply. Corona was there. But we don't have the courage to face it. What happened to the milk? Even if a small problem comes, we need tablets, we need a heart injection, when it comes to the cost of 5,000, Corona will come even more today. What is happening is, look at this, there is zero dust here. I was talking to my brother Rasool Anwar about this before you came. Here, there is zero dust. What do you see in Bengaluru? In Kopala district, there is Bishulu, Bargala, Dula, Go there. There is Badatana. Badatana, Kuspa. There is no water. No, that is wrong. It is an exchange. To give the world a smell, we are creating a Malaynad. We all have a high, full height. We should build a forest in Bishul. We should build a forest in Bharat. That forest should be a smelly forest. It should be a bad one. Yes. And it is possible. Because it is a very native species of us, and it is a very adaptable species. But? It is easy for us to get it. Yes, sir. And only in special occasions, this environment is very beautiful. Oh. There should not be any big problem. Yes, sir. Now, we have been told, if you get this much, you will get a lot of comments. When you spread this on YouTube, you will get comments like, this is a mistake, this is an exaggeration. Exaggerated figures. Yes, exaggeration. There will be so many comments. There should be a strong belief, self-confidence, and concentration on work. That is needed. I am not saying that I am talking about my studies. Oh. I am saying that I need a job. What is happening today is, we are watching TV. A big Srimanth, a big institution in some state, is going to be there. The IS is not going to be there. In a temple, they are going to be there. They are going to be ranked as the IS pass. Yes. Why? How? Strong belief, self-confidence, and concentration. We need a consistent effort. Oh. So, what is happening today is, Sri Gandha, we are the second generation, our father, Dalembe. Dalembe is our father, who has built a rich and prosperous life. He is the son of Devendra Prabhupada. In this part, the name of the person is known. Now, the National Dalembe Foundation is the foundation. The National Pome Grants Growers Association is the vice president. He has built a rich and prosperous life. But, he can also be a small farmer. He can be a farmer who has very little water. What I can say is, his self-confidence and his love for planting trees is that he can plant trees without any borewell. We need to work hard to make him a good farmer. We have done all that. We have done it. We have done it on the basis of forest. We have done it on the basis of forest. We are doing a project on the basis of forest. Can we do it on the basis of forest? How is that possible? It is not possible. We need something. We are doing a project on this. Step by step. He has built a dam on the basis of forest. There is no water source. There is no borewell. He is doing it with a lot of effort. But, in the middle of this, I am talking about Srikandha, and then I am talking about Thavukya. But, for this, we need a good situation. This is a land of smell. This is a land of smell. But, along with this, there is a great value in the way of conservation. There is a great value. There is a great value. Do you know what is the food? Sandalwood oil. A good smell of Srikandha. Today, KSDL is called as Moissu Sandal. Soaps and detergents. KSDL. They are retailing. 5g and 10g, 2 packs. Half a pack for 1 pack. Half a pack for 20000, half a pack for 50000. 10g? We need a good basis. Today, one pack of Srikandha costs 5000 rupees. 10g. 10g for 5000, 100g for 50000, 1000g for 50000. One kilo of Srikandha, the Karnataka government is doing it in Karnataka, at a rate of 5 lakh rupees per kg. We should know. Today, the Karnataka government is doing it in Karnataka, one kilo of Srikandha costs 5 lakh rupees. That is the price we pay for our work. That means, the honey is being harvested, the quality of the Srikandha is good, there is no harm in that, there is no disease. That is the way we do it. That is the rule. When we go there, there is no harm in that. But, because of the price, we are always in the management, when we are working on a project, we look at the strength, what is the strength of that project, what are the weaknesses, what are the opportunities, and what are the challenges. SWAT analysis. SWAT is SWAT analysis. Strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats. There are no threats, threats are challenges. SWAT became SWAT. That is challenge. If you go in this standard route, there is a challenge. Protection. Because it has a great value. A great value. If you do this, you will not get the government's property. Sir, here, in the government's property, it belongs to everyone, to the government, but not to anyone. Government. Not to anyone. Office. Everyone. Government office. Government hospital. That belongs to everyone. Why? I am coming from Kundur. Is it yours? It is ours. But not to anyone. He eats there and sleeps there. Why does he sleep there? Look at the hospital. How well it is built. All the walls are made of wood. Because this is the connection. That type of experience. What is happening now is, if there is a place for security, there is no job for that. That is a security trap. Public. Public property. What is happening here? I will give you all my Aadhar numbers. You have covered three cameras.

Your eyes will not come to our eyes. Our eyes will not come to us. Our neighbors will not come to us. They know the way. Yes. Today, when I go to work, even here the workers are experienced. When I go to work, the one who will learn it is the one who is with us. We will see. So, where is the risk? There is a return. No risk, no returns. It will be equal. What has happened today is, because of the price, the search has been done. It is not there. It is not there. So, we have to take the necessary steps. We have to give knowledge there. Now we have opportunities. We have technology. We have all the technology. Today we can put cameras, sensors, traps, dogs, and we can do fencing. We don't have to build a compound for fencing. I will show you a bamboo saw. It is a thick bamboo. If we put it 5 feet deep, it will be 20 feet deep. It will be good for fencing, and windbreaker. Even a 20 feet tall tree can be built.

SandalWoodNewsStories_146,"Shostiraёл lane needs to be open to many teams mainly in the short, medium- and long term. When the farmer gets retired, he does the silage, do the thinning and infuse the affirmative and then farm. There are mavas, cibes, gudambis, and sithapal trees. We are demonstrating a place where there is a place for a smell to grow. The smell is a parasite. It cannot generate its nutrients. That is why it gathers the berries and other trees to observe the nutrients. Now you may not have a tree nearby, but there are many trees here. But according to our demonstration, the trees we have planted will give good nutrients to the smell. Is the distance to the sithapal trees too much? No, if you put it a lot, it is a little bit. If you go to the forest, the smell is the same. The smell is not far away. The smell is in the middle of the tree. At the beginning, the roots are half-way down. The berries and other trees must be locked. That is when the tree is taken care of. After 18-20 years, you will see a lot of crop diversity. You can grow agricultural crops or oilseeds. But after 18-20 years, you will see a permanent growth of the crop. But we don't say that it is the only thing that is left. There is no host plant. You can't get anything if you don't have a tree. So we say to plant a tree in the middle of the diversity. We plant about 50-60 trees per acre. I have mentioned about the food forest. Food and forest must be there. When there is a forest, wood is available and it helps nature. We have a variety of food here. We have three varieties of sitapal. This is red sitapal, that is also red sitapal, this is gold sitapal, and this is peanut butter. What we think about the trees is that... Look at this tomato. This is a cutback tomato. This is a natural pole. The farmers spend a lot of money on cutting the tomatoes. So you might not have 10 tons of tomatoes. But if you take one, you will have a good environment and food. You will have a good agriculture. Short term, medium term, long term. When the farmer is retired and he has a farm, he will have a tree to plant. This is a third year crop. This is five years old. After that, we have to plant it. The ecosystem should develop. Roots should be there. Then we can survive. Otherwise, we have to grow another tree. Look at this. This is called... Is this a native tree? No, it is not. There is no hybrid or hybrid in this. It is our native tree.",shostira lane needs to be open to many teams mainly in the short medium and long term when the farmer gets retired he does the silage do the thinning and infuse the affirmative and then farm there are mavas cibes gudambis and sithapal trees we are demonstrating a place where there is a place for a smell to grow the smell is a parasite it cannot generate its nutrients that is why it gathers the berries and other trees to observe the nutrients now you may not have a tree nearby but there are many trees here but according to our demonstration the trees we have planted will give good nutrients to the smell is the distance to the sithapal trees too much no if you put it a lot it is a little bit if you go to the forest the smell is the same the smell is not far away the smell is in the middle of the tree at the beginning the roots are halfway down the berries and other trees must be locked that is when the tree is taken care of after years you will see a lot of crop diversity you can grow agricultural crops or oilseeds but after years you will see a permanent growth of the crop but we dont say that it is the only thing that is left there is no host plant you cant get anything if you dont have a tree so we say to plant a tree in the middle of the diversity we plant about trees per acre i have mentioned about the food forest food and forest must be there when there is a forest wood is available and it helps nature we have a variety of food here we have three varieties of sitapal this is red sitapal that is also red sitapal this is gold sitapal and this is peanut butter what we think about the trees is that look at this tomato this is a cutback tomato this is a natural pole the farmers spend a lot of money on cutting the tomatoes so you might not have tons of tomatoes but if you take one you will have a good environment and food you will have a good agriculture short term medium term long term when the farmer is retired and he has a farm he will have a tree to plant this is a third year crop this is five years old after that we have to plant it the ecosystem should develop roots should be there then we can survive otherwise we have to grow another tree look at this this is called is this a native tree no it is not there is no hybrid or hybrid in this it is our native tree

SandalWoodNewsStories_144,"Hi, welcome to Daru Group. Today we are in Sringada garden. This is a garden that we have developed a year ago. It is a little far from that, but I am telling you as a reference. Because we have made three videos about this same garden. In the same year, from the day of planting, after 6 months, what kind of results have been shown. Today it has been a year. Today we are doing is, I will tell you some details. In the previous video, our farmer will give his opinion. You can watch. If anyone is new to the channel, please subscribe to the channel. If you are watching the video, please subscribe. Subscription is free. Please do it. If you have not joined the channel yet, you can join the channel. There will be an exclusive video. If you are interested, there may be a complete detail. If you have a direct contact with the team, if you have a chance, through video calling, if you show your garden, we will give you a consultation. This is our plot. What we have done here is, we have alternated G Vilas and Srikandha. In this 3 acres area, we have G Vilas and Srikandha. This is the name. The reason for this plot is, in this area, when the crop is being cultivated, sugar cane cultivation was going on. We have selected that plot. We have selected it and we have recognized the lowest point and highest point. We know the height and the low point. We have identified the lowest point and the lowest point. Because the water from the next stream comes out of the water. The water from the stream comes out of the water. We have identified that first. We have taken the drip channels and the planting direction for the same line. Interproperly, from the last one year, coriander is being grown here. Coriander is being grown here. The opinion of Anish's is, the yield and profit is being taken and the yield is being taken. You can see the size of the plant. I will show you the plant and the plant. For this Srikandha, everytime we say, Choguchha is one of the best hosts. One is the plant and the other is the plant. You can see, our plant has completely flowered. It has bloomed completely in one year. The growth is very fast. The maturity level is high. Then, the reference of this garden is here. Look at the size of the plant. Look at the plant. It is completely round. The size and color. It is not like a regular chemical spray. It is not like a regular chemical spray. It is like a fungal related spray. We are only taking this for the disease that comes from the fevamsha. There is more fevamsha. I am saying that there is more fevamsha. When the plant is in the garden, the surrounding, the plants grow here, more water is released here, and when the water is released, the fevamsha grows in the normal way. We can see the fungal relativity here. We can see the fungal infection in the other plants. But, another highlight of this plot is that all the plants have even growth. Look at this. All the plants have even growth. To achieve even growth, I always say that mother plant is very important. If you have collected seeds, how you have developed the plant in the nursery, I am talking about Srikandha. From this mother plant, you can achieve even growth of sandalwood. Otherwise, your growth will be small, big, and chances are very low. I am collecting fruits here. Minimum 400 grams plus. You can see Srikandha here. To achieve even growth, I told you about seeds and host. When we give the seeds properly, you can also plant a beautiful garden. If you are nearby, from the Belgaam district, if you want to go to this garden, you can go to Hidikkal. I will give the number of this place. If you contact us, you can go there, develop the garden, share your opinion in the comments, and then what other friends will do there is how to get yield, what are the procedures, we will be making another video about that. Every year, from 1 to 1.5 lakhs, they collect it in one time. Every year, from 2 to 3 lakhs, they collect it from just coriander. This is for everyone to know, and for the benefit of everyone. We will make a video for that. Look at this plant, it is so healthy and green. Look at the size of all the plants, look at the color, the shape of the leaves, friends, it is the same. Because, from our Dharvit, if you have developed it in this plantation, it will be even aged. Then, it will grow in growth rate. From our plant, it will be 2 to 3 rupees more expensive. But, from our plant, if you don't get any service, if you get any feedback, to develop a beautiful garden, that 2 rupees is not a big deal. Because, if you have 15 years of experience, and 8 years of knowledge, and if you have 1 to 2 rupees less, please inform your friends. Contact the number on the screen, and if you need information, you can contact. Now, our farmer will tell you, please come and see. Namaskar sir. What is your name? I am from Kedang.

We talk to the farmers. They come to us and believe in us. When we do all the work, we have time. We don't even have time to call and call. This video's first part is what we have done during the planting time. You can see that in the description. I have put the link. You can see the gate. You can see the inside of the building. No one has thought about the plan to build this fort for 6 or 8 months. We have shown the result to the people of this town. You can visit this place and get the results. We have fenced the whole place. This is not a barbed wire fence. We have mesh fenced it. We will save this fort. We will put an electric fence. If you want to put it on top, you can do barbed wire fence. We will maintain this fort for 7 to 8 feet. They are doing it so neatly. If you want to develop your fort, contact us. We will give you a registration link. We will register and put you in the fort. They will plan and execute it. If you like the video, like, share and subscribe.

SandalWoodNewsStories_200,"Hi, Namaskar. Today I am going to share a good topic. Microchip. For women, it is for protection. Everyone has a problem, everyone has a dream. How to protect their smell, how to make profit from it. I will tell you how to install the chip, how much it costs, when to install it, how long it takes. I will give you a complete description of how to install the battery. Come and see. If you haven't subscribed to any other channel, please subscribe to the channel. Share this video in your groups. Because this information, or this information, is being given in different ways. It can be in newspapers or in other articles. That is, I will buy this chip and go. Tell me what this chip will do for me. I will give you a complete description of it. Come and see. If you see here, this is a lot that we have already installed the chip. That is, prototype. This is being tested for the chip. But when the testing is done, this chip is being used to make a mesh for the walls you see here. This is a wall that has been here for about 18 to 25 years. This is the wall that is being installed. For this, they are putting a chip here and giving protection. That is, testing is done. But they have installed a mesh here. Why have they installed a mesh? Because someone is trying to get this wall to work. This is one of the protection. If you put a mesh here, it will not be able to work. That is why they have installed this. Then why have they installed it from 5 to 8 feet? If you ask, the smell is only 5 feet from the other. The other one is completely full of smell. Then the wall is not working. That is why they have installed this. This is the same as the other one. This is the same as the other one. This is the same as the other one. The smell of the wall is only 5 feet above the ground. That is why you get a hardwood. What you see there is a small memory chip. That is a security chip. In common terms, security chip is a small one. It works as a security chip. But this chip is the most expensive. The price of this chip is 500 to 800 rupees. For today's price, it can be less. But what I am saying is, If you put a chip here, it will be visible to the eye. If it is visible to the eye, how can it be protected? The question is very important. Now I will tell you in detail. If the voice is not correct here, There is a sound issue. We are recording this again. Here you can see the wall. This is a 8 year old wall. This is a chip. This is another type. This is the size of the chip. The size of the chip is 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches. This is in the shape of a wall. The chip is visible. It will come in the same shape and color. That is because it is a camouflage. It is a kind of camouflage. It is a camouflage that is a camouflage. It is a camouflage that is a camouflage. But it is visible to the eye. It is not a big deal. What we did in the prototype is, 8 feet. I put this chip in a 8 feet long stick. I put this chip in a 8 feet long stick. What this chip does is, It will create vibrations. When you cut the wire, When you cut the wire, What sound will come? What sound will come? When you put it in the machine, It creates vibrations. It will give you an alarm. It will give you an alarm. It will give you an alarm. It will give you an alarm. When you give an alarm, You will see the difference. If you don't have an alarm, You can see how much protection you can give. If you don't have an alarm, After the wire is cut, Why does the eye put the chip? Why does the eye put the chip? The eye is looking at the chip. We put it in the hole. It is needed. There is a number, 29. It will remove the number and It will remove the number and It will remove the chip and go in the hole. Now, how can you trace the chip? Now, how can you trace the chip? The chip is not that reliable. The chip will be lost completely. The chip will be lost completely. The chip will be lost completely. What do I mean by that? Many people think so. There is no problem if you put a chip. There is no problem if you put a chip. The second problem is, The second problem is, What do they say when they come from Mysore? They say, I will take 80 rupees and take the wall, I will put a chip in the first hole and come to the wall for 8 years and come to the wall for 8 years and come to the wall for 8 years and the wall will be small. They are all fake companies. I will come next year and give you free fencing. I will give you 50 rupees from the previous year. I will give you free chip for 7 years. I will give you free chip for 7 years. All these are fake. All these are fake. No one is coming from Mysore. I am telling you that. The first challenge is, take your responsibility. Don't give your responsibility to anyone. Don't give your responsibility to anyone. Don't give your responsibility to anyone. Your dream, your land, your money, When all this is yours, why do you have a major concern when others believe that you are going to lose your security? That is my request. The cost is 500 to 800 rupees. The cost is 500 to 800 rupees. The cost is 500 to 800 rupees. Again, another problem. I will tell you that. Another problem is, every 3 years, you have to change the battery. The battery cost is 50 to 70 rupees. If you change the cell, the cell will be the same as the watch. If you change the cell, your life will be better. As of now, the chip will be at least 1 to 2 years old to come out of the prototype. If you want to give security to the security, you have to put a mesh on the border and then put a dog on the border and then install an alarm system called point sensors. and then install an alarm system called point sensors. and then install an alarm system called point sensors. What point sensors do is, if someone is running at night, it will give you a signal, it will automatically start making sounds. I have done all this and I hope you liked this video.

to rupees if you change the cell the cell will be the same as the watch if you change the cell your life will be better as of now the chip will be at least to years old to come out of the prototype if you want to give security to the security you have to put a mesh on the border and then put a dog on the border and then install an alarm system called point sensors and then install an alarm system called point sensors and then install an alarm system called point sensors what point sensors do is if someone is running at night it will give you a signal it will automatically start making sounds i

SandalWoodNewsStories_215,"Have you ever planted cole walnuts on the fields at home? Over last 30 years, activates the Shakeable Nuts Ranch. There is no step by step we have taken all the flour. We have taken the flour in the Tiku, Onni, Mahagani, we have put the Nimbay, and then the C.B. We have taken the flour in the few days that we get the grain. We have taken the flour in the few days that we get the grain. We have about 16 types of flour. We have about 20,000 Sri Gandas of flour. It has been 7 years since we crossed. We have started to get the flour in the Kerala, in some places. The more host we give, the better the Sri Gandas are. Especially in the dry land, the Karnataka border, the Karnataka Mysore, the Chamaraji Nagara, Kolar, Chikbalapura, all these are specially the Sri Gandas have more oil content. Percent of Sanitary is more, so these belt farmers can pay attention to it. When it rains, you should put the flour in the rainy season and wait for 3 to 4 years to ferment it. After 3 years, the crop develops and then you get the crop. The first three years you water the tractor, then you have to work hard to build it. Slowly you will get the fruit. What else do you need? We don't need anything else. We can give you corn, we don't need minerals, urea, complex. If you want, you can use tea, you can use pruning, you can use the corn that is grown in the fields, you can make it like a natural corn. You can make it natural. If you don't have enough water, you can use one or two sacks of water and you can use the drums. If you don't have enough water, you can use the drums. How long will you develop the oil? According to the environment, some people ask for 10 or 15 years, some people ask for 20 years. If you get all the natural benefits, you will get oil for 4 years. So for 4 years, what I have seen in my farm, I have worked in the fields for 4 years, but the oil content has been low. It has been 4 years since I started the farm. I have not done anything by book, it is natural. It can be 15 years. Some people come for 10 years, some people for 15 years. There is a difference between 10 and 15 years. For 10 years, you can get 5 kg or 3 kg of rice. For 15 years, you can get 10 kg, 12 kg, 20 kg. It depends on the age of the tree. You can see what you have done. You can do it. One thing is that the white ants, the red ants, they eat a lot of ants. If you see them in a hurry, you will not find anything else. Is it suitable for red soil only or black soil? For clay soil? It can be suitable for all soils, but what is the oil content? Red loomis oil or stone soil, small stones, you call it. Red soil is very good for all soils. It is good for all soils. It is good for all areas. But oil content is more in these areas. What is the security? You have to take care of the security. No one else has come. You can't do it. They say you can do it. You can do it. You can do fencing and do it. If you do it on a small scale, it will be very difficult. Because it is very difficult to take care of everything with 500 to 1000 bricks. Because the money you earn will be taken care of. For that, if you do it on a large scale, 2000 to 3000 bricks, how many bricks do you put? Usually, 400 bricks is ideal. We have done it in high density. We have put 600 to 700 bricks. We have put 400 bricks. That's a good method. It is good. Even if it is dry land, you can do it on 5 acres. What will happen? You can use the soap you have cut for 3 years for your money and work. It will be profitable. If you do it for 10 years, the seeds will come. They will come and give you 100 to 150 rupees per kg. From that, you will get money. If you sow for 10 years, you will get money. You can put 10 to 20 bricks or whatever you want and grow it. You can get money from that. What about the blood donation? We have 1000 bricks of blood donation. It has been 8 to 6 years. We have not done the plantation for a year. Every year, we do a plantation in the rainy season. We replant the bricks that we have planted. We have all the stages in our farm. We have 4 to 8 years of bricks. We do it in the morning. Everyone should do the same. If you do the plantation and leave it, it will not grow. You can't reach the expectation. Is there any silver in the soil? Yes, there is. We have all the plants. We support them. We don't have a host. Some hosts may be bad, bad, but they are good. But we have a host for every plant. We don't have a species. Do you need to take the stones? No, we don't need them. Do you have to cut the stones? Yes, we can. We can cut the stones and make an open grazing system. Open grazing is not possible for 3 to 4 years. Every plant will be eaten and the plant will rot. If it is over 5 to 6 feet, it will take minimum 3 years. After 3 years, you can open graze. Is there any problem with the permission of the forest department? No problem. The forest will supply you with a tree for 3 rupees. They will give you the amount you need. You should look for a good place and get a tree where the seeds are. Don't go to the nurses and get a bad tree. Don't go to the nurses and get a bad tree. You should get a good tree and get a good tree and get a good tree. There is no need to hurry. The oil content will only come if the plant grows faster than the fast growth. If you get a cultured tea and get a tea, there is no oil content. No one has to pay 50 to 100 rupees to get a good tree. Just the forest and the nurses will get a good tree. You can do that. Don't be afraid of getting a good tree and getting a bad tree. Don't think about the cost of the tree and get a good tree. Don't think about the cost of the tree and get a bad tree. If you do that and get a good tree, you will get a good tree. You will get a good tree. If you get a good tree, you can get 500 trees. You can get 100 trees from the white ants. If you get 500 trees from the white ants, you can get 500 trees from the white ants. You can do whatever you want in your life. Do you contact saplings? We don't go to change saplings. We don't touch them. You can ask the local nurses or the government nurses or the places where you can trust the trees. We have Chintamani, Srinivasapura, Kolarra. All the nurses are in the forest department and they have passed the resolution. They should do the srikandha in every nursery. If you ask all the forest department, they will provide you with the trees. You can ask the local nurses. Do you have any tips to prevent the forest? I don't know how many tips have been used to prevent the forest. I just want you to stay at home. I just want you to stay at home. That is the only principle. The government helps, the police helps, there is no one at that time. So, you should fencing and you should take care of the animals.

are now being harvested this is a old tree but the roots are still there this is a full hardwood tree friends you can change the roots even if they fall you will understand when you see this video hi namaskar welcome to darubru todays video is about the old tree what to do if the tree falls i will tell you how to grow it i will give you some information this video is shot at an optical angle it is shot at a slightly horizontal angle you can see that all the trees are cut down if there is no smell the trees are left like that there are about trees here there is a fence border there is nothing beyond the fence it was open because it was years old you can see that the trees are not very big naturally they were left as they were but the next night this video was shot in the rain we did it that much late what they did was they cut down the trees at night they said there was no smell they are leaving it i will show you what kind of smell they have when they are completely cut down but what you have to do in this condition as soon as they are cut down there is a paste called beltox friends you have to kill it because fungal infection does not occur the tree is still alive even if it is cut down it will live cells will develop it will not give the same effect if you put the beltox paste tightly if you see the air coming out of one place it will definitely grow again friends there is no doubt about it the second thing is no need to put electric fencing then you do not have to put it whatever you were doing the smell with other crops first give protection they have completely cut down the tree so as i said for protection first use electric fencing use the same as the other crops use the same as the other crops use the same as the other crops it is not wrong to use the same as the other crops if you put it in the same way it will be even more happy because it will be a contribution to nature if you go to the carbon sequestration it will come to the field it will be to protection as i said it is mixed with the soil and other crops but the host is mango i will tell you that if you do not know about the host you can do the th year plantation when they do it for years they do not have access to research they do not have internet they have government and other employees they do not have time to go and do it we cannot do anything about this because it is getting old when it is years old you can see it there so what to do plan first i do not need to years what i am doing in this field for the last years i am not utilizing it properly if you want to do it then i

SandalWoodNewsStories_197,"In the future...andele ... ... ... ... .... Okay so, In the present~~ relative Positive Michelle Correct and Thank you Hey class, Halli, Salut ya Asband But it failed so well. Why did it fail? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? I will tell you the reason behind it. We have seen in the epics and in the puranas that Srinanda is suffering from this. There is no need to discuss it. There are a lot of news about it. A medicine company is using oil. They have published a paper about the cancer. Srinanda is still in the white. The price of Srinanda is so high that some industries depend on the price of Srinanda. They are not doing their own plantation. I have told you about the panparag industry. In Mandhya Pradesh, there is a place called Kutni. They are doing a plantation there. They are doing their own business. They are doing the panparag business. They are trying to get the scent of Srinanda. They are trying to get the scent of Srinanda. Otherwise, the scent will not be used. Srinanda is a fixed-eater. They don't need the oil. They are doing a plantation there. In Karnataka, there are many countries that are interested in Srinanda. They are doing their own plantation. They are doing their own business. In Maharashtra, they are doing their own training. They are doing their own nursery. It is not a traditional area. It is important to know. Economics is active. I have told you about economics. Why should you know economics? When we come to that, instead of getting Srinanda, if we want to compare the Srinanda with Srinanda, we should know economics of Srinanda. Because when we get Srinanda, there are many challenges. What do you say? How do you know the seedling? We should study the seeds, check the damage, do marketing and get money. We should know the value of the seeds when we get such a challenging crop. We should know the value of the seeds. If we know the value of the seeds, we should know the value of the seeds. If we want to make a decision, economics of Srinanda is very important. When we talk about economics of Srinanda, if we know the complexity of the Srinanda, we can understand the value of the seeds. We can understand the value of the seeds. We can understand the value of the seeds. Srinanda is a challenging crop. We should not just grow Srinanda, we should also grow other crops. We should not just grow Srinanda, we should also grow other crops. That is why it is a bit challenging. If we understand the complexity, economics will be understood. First, Srinanda has a good price, then there is a challenging crop, then there is a price that we have to pay, and then there is an alternate host. Decision making. We should make decisions at every stage. If we make a decision at any stage, we should observe the complexity. I will explain it in the next slide. These are different crops. We can understand the complexity. We can understand the complexity. We can understand the complexity. At Geof Sergeantinnas, when they don't work, they can grow Srin legitimacy. But we haven't heard of the same backing applications. It all**** and ***** So what we do is, we first test the soil in the sand. This is what we collect in the fish and science centers, universities and science lab. They give a reasonable rate of test and report. In that report, the soil is less because the soil is less. The soil scientists will ask if the tree crops can grow here. They will give a report. The sand has a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. pH is safe. We need hydrogen ion concentration. That means we need hydrogen ion concentration. The pH is very important. The pH is the imbalance that the plants can't grow from the soil. The pH is the imbalance that the plants can't grow from the soil. The plants can't absorb the soil. If the soil has neutral pH, the absorption and exchange rate is correct. The soil can't grow from the soil. That's why we need to look at the pH. We need to look at the organic carbon too. If it is organic carbon, how much carbon is there in it? If the organic carbon content is good, there will be more carbon in the soil. If the absorption is good, you can use it to supply your plants. That's why we need to look at the pH. After the soil test, the soil has neutral pH. The soil can grow from the soil. There is no problem. We can select the soil and see if it can grow from the soil. After the soil test, we need to do land preparation. We need to do land preparation. If there are too many stones and stones, we need to maintain the soil. That's why we need to do land preparation. If there are too many stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones, stones,

June, we have to do planting on June so before planting, we have to do fitting when to do fitting, how to do fitting, at what distance to do fitting, why to do fitting all these questions come to mind right? to do fitting, I say we have to have a head usually we recommend to have a head in 40 cm, 40 cm, 40 cm, 40 cm we should have a head in 40 cm and 40 cm why should we have a head in 40 cm and 40 cm because we have a head in 40 cm and 40 cm we have to leave the size 6 cm for the head and make it to fit we have to have a head, when should we do fitting I asked you a question, to do planting on June should we do fitting 1 month before or 3 months before You should always do the bunting because during January and February, you should not think about doing the bunting because during January and February, when the winter ends, the base starts from March to April, there is a full base what happens in that base is that the bunting is not given what happens is that the soil is exposed to the sun's rays when the sun's rays are on the soil, the sun's rays are visible when the wall is built, the clouds are visible, it is dead one side till the bunting is done, it is said that the topsoil is not there, it is the soil that is exposed the soil that is exposed is taken from one side and the soil that is exposed is taken from the other side next, the bunting is done in February, the bunting is done, in February and March the soil is dry for a period of time if you have separated the soil, next is the canting to do the canting we have given the place we have given the place, we have to remove the plastic cover we have to remove the plastic cover and the ceiling we have to remove the ceiling and the bunting the soil that is exposed to the sun's rays is there we have to remove that and then you have to add the farm yard manure 2 kgs, 3 kgs, 1 bag of farm yard manure if you mix the farm yard manure with the soil you have more water holding capacity done done when you do the planting, you have to do the flood irrigation all the plants have to do the flood irrigation to make the water flow well because when you start planting in June one rain will fall, another will come you don't know if you don't take this risk, the first plant will grow well the second plant will grow well, the water will flow well",in the futureandele okay so in the present relative positive

not just grow srinanda we should also grow other crops that is why it is a bit challenging if we understand the complexity economics will be understood first srinanda has a good price then there is a challenging crop then there is a price that we have to pay and then there is an alternate host decision making we should make decisions at every stage if we make a decision at any stage we should observe the complexity i will explain it in the next slide these are different crops we can understand the complexity we can understand the complexity we can understand the complexity at geof sergeantinnas when they dont work they can grow srin legitimacy but we havent heard of the same backing applications it all and so what we do is we first test the soil in the sand this is what we collect in the fish and science centers universities and science lab they give a reasonable rate of test and report in that report the soil is less because the soil is less the soil scientists will ask if the tree crops can grow here they will give a report the sand has a ph of to ph is safe we need hydrogen ion concentration that means we need hydrogen ion concentration the ph is very important the ph is the imbalance that the plants cant grow from the soil the ph is the imbalance that the plants cant grow from the soil the plants cant absorb the soil if the soil has neutral ph the absorption and exchange rate is correct the soil cant grow from the soil thats why we need to look at the ph we need to look at the organic carbon too if it is organic carbon how much carbon is there in it if the organic carbon content is good there will be more carbon in the soil if the absorption is good you can use it to supply your plants thats why we need to look at the ph after the soil test the soil has neutral ph the soil can grow from the soil there is no problem we can select the soil and see if it can grow from the soil after the soil test we need to do land preparation we need to do land preparation if there are too many stones and stones we need to maintain the soil thats why we need to do land preparation if there are too many stones stones stones stones stones stones stones

stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones stones we have to do planting on june we have to do planting on june so before planting we have to do fitting when to do fitting how to do fitting at what distance to do fitting why to do fitting all these questions come to mind right to do fitting i say we have to have a head usually we recommend to have a head in cm cm cm cm we should have a head in cm and cm why should we have a head in cm and cm because we have a head in cm and cm we have to leave the size cm for the head and make it to fit we have to have a head when should we do fitting i asked you a question to do planting on june should we do fitting month before or months before you should always do the bunting because during january and february you should not think about doing the bunting because during january and february when the winter ends the base starts from march to april there is a full base what happens in that base is that the bunting is not given what happens is that the soil is exposed to the suns rays when the suns rays are on the soil the suns rays are visible when the wall is built the clouds are visible it is dead one side till the bunting is done it is said that the topsoil is not there it is the soil that is exposed the soil that is exposed is taken from one side and the soil that is exposed is taken from the other side next the bunting is done in february the bunting is done in february and march the soil is dry for a period of time if you have separated the soil next is the canting to do the canting we have given the place we have given the place we have to remove the plastic cover we have to remove the plastic cover and the ceiling we have to remove the ceiling and the bunting the soil that is exposed to the suns rays is there we have to remove that and then you have to add the farm yard manure kgs kgs bag of farm yard manure if you mix the farm yard manure with the soil you have more water holding capacity done done when you do the planting you have to do the flood irrigation all the plants have to do the flood irrigation to make the water flow well because when you start planting in june one rain will fall another will come you dont know if you dont take this risk the first plant will grow well the second plant will grow well the water will flow well
